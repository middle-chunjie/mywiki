###### Abstract

Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown strong results on multi-turn tool-use tasks, yet they operate in isolation during training, failing to leverage experiences accumulated across episodes. Existing experience-augmented methods address this by organizing trajectories into retrievable libraries, but they retrieve experiences only once based on the initial task description and hold them constant throughout the episode. In multi-turn settings where observations change at every step, this static retrieval becomes increasingly mismatched as episodes progress. We propose SLEA-RL (Step-Level Experience-Augmented Reinforcement Learning), a framework that retrieves relevant experiences at each decision step conditioned on the current observation. SLEA-RL operates through three components: (i) step-level observation clustering that groups structurally equivalent environmental states for efficient cluster-indexed retrieval; (ii) a self-evolving experience library that distills successful strategies and failure patterns through score-based admission and rate-limited extraction; and (iii) policy optimization with step-level credit assignment for fine-grained advantage estimation across multi-turn episodes. The experience library evolves alongside the policy through semantic analysis rather than gradient updates. Experiments on long-horizon multi-turn agent benchmarks demonstrate that SLEA-RL achieves superior performance compared to various reinforcement learning baselines. Our code is available at [https://github.com/kingofspace0wzz/slea-rl/](https://github.com/kingofspace0wzz/slea-rl/ "").

Training curves are included in Appendix[E](#A5 "Appendix E Training curves. ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training").*

Large language model (LLM) agents*(Yao et al., [2022b](#bib.bib27 "ReAct: synergizing reasoning and acting in language models"); Shinn et al., [2023](#bib.bib28 "Reflexion: language agents with verbal reinforcement learning"))* have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across complex tasks such as web navigation*(Yao et al., [2022a](#bib.bib25 "Webshop: towards scalable real-world web interaction with grounded language agents"))*, embodied planning*(Shridhar et al., [2021](#bib.bib24 "ALFWorld: Aligning Text and Embodied Environments for Interactive Learning"))*, and tool-integrated reasoning*(Jin et al., [2025](#bib.bib40 "Search-r1: training LLMs to reason and leverage search engines with reinforcement learning"))*. Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training these agents, with group-based algorithms such as GRPO*(Guo et al., [2025](#bib.bib9 "DeepSeek-r1: incentivizing reasoning capability in LLMs via reinforcement learning"))* and Dr. GRPO*(Liu et al., [2025](#bib.bib10 "Understanding r1-zero-like training: a critical perspective"))* proving especially effective. Despite these advances, each task execution remains largely episodic: current LLM agents operate in isolation, unable to learn from past successes or failures across episodes, which significantly hinders their evolution.

Multi-turn tool-use tasks—such as ALFWorld*(Shridhar et al., [2021](#bib.bib24 "ALFWorld: Aligning Text and Embodied Environments for Interactive Learning"))*, WebShop*(Yao et al., [2022a](#bib.bib25 "Webshop: towards scalable real-world web interaction with grounded language agents"))*, and interactive web search—present a fundamentally different challenge than single-turn reasoning*(Achiam et al., [2023](#bib.bib1 "GPT-4 technical report"); Hui et al., [2024](#bib.bib3 "Qwen2.5-coder technical report"); Team et al., [2023](#bib.bib2 "Gemini: a family of highly capable multimodal models"); Liu et al., [2024](#bib.bib4 "DeepSeek-v3 technical report"))*. Unlike static settings where the context remains fixed throughout generation, multi-turn environments change at every step: each action reveals a new room configuration, each click surfaces new listings. The agent must continuously adapt its reasoning to an ever-changing world state across dozens of sequential decisions.
Standard RL approaches*(Schulman et al., [2017](#bib.bib5 "Proximal policy optimization algorithms"); Ahmadian et al., [2024](#bib.bib8 "Back to basics: revisiting reinforce-style optimization for learning from human feedback in llms"); Guo et al., [2025](#bib.bib9 "DeepSeek-r1: incentivizing reasoning capability in LLMs via reinforcement learning"); Zheng et al., [2025a](#bib.bib38 "Group sequence policy optimization"); Feng et al., [2025](#bib.bib11 "Group-in-group policy optimization for LLM agent training"))* face three compounding challenges in this setting. First, each training rollout acts in isolation: episodes begin from scratch with no memory of prior interactions, causing the agent to repeat mistakes and discard successful strategies across thousands of rollouts. Second, most multi-turn environments provide only *sparse, outcome-level rewards*, leaving dozens of intermediate steps without learning signal and making credit assignment difficult. Third, RL training proceeds purely through *weight updates*, discarding the structured, interpretable knowledge that accumulates across episodes in a form that could directly guide future behavior.

Recent work on experience-augmented agents*(Xia et al., [2026](#bib.bib18 "SkillRL: evolving agents via recursive skill-augmented reinforcement learning"); Zhang et al., [2026](#bib.bib19 "Memrl: self-evolving agents via runtime reinforcement learning on episodic memory"); Cai et al., [2025b](#bib.bib22 "Flex: continuous agent evolution via forward learning from experience"))* addresses the first limitation by organizing successful trajectories into retrievable libraries. However, these methods perform *task-level* retrieval: a fixed set of experiences is fetched once based on the initial task description and held constant for the entire episode. In multi-turn settings, this provides increasingly stale context as the environment state diverges from the original task prompt. Hence, these limitations raise a core question:


The key insight is that relevant accumulated experience is *state-dependent*: the strategies useful when a WebShop agent first navigates to a product category differ fundamentally from those needed when comparing two specific items at checkout twenty steps later. This state-dependence connects naturally to step-level credit assignment:


Just as not all intermediate actions deserve equal credit for the episode outcome, not all steps benefit equally from the same retrieved experiences. Step-level retrieval addresses both dimensions simultaneously: by conditioning retrieved experiences on the current observation, agents receive targeted support at exactly the steps where it matters, improving the quality of the exploratory actions that receive fine-grained credit.

To this end, we propose SLEA-RL (Step-Level Experience-Augmented Reinforcement Learning), a multi-turn RL framework that integrates step-level experience retrieval directly into the training loop. At each decision step, SLEA-RL retrieves relevant experiences from a structured experience library conditioned on the current observation, injecting them via format-preserving augmentation. To enable efficient retrieval at scale, SLEA-RL clusters structurally equivalent observations into equivalence classes, so that experiences proven effective at one state immediately benefit all similar states across trajectories. The experience library self-evolves through quality-controlled semantic analysis of the best and worst trajectories each epoch, with score-based admission and rate-limited extraction maintaining quality under continuous update pressure. Crucially, experiences are used during both training and inference, ensuring that the policy learns to effectively leverage retrieved experiences rather than treating them as a test-time artifact.
Our main contributions are:

* •

    Step-level experience retrieval with observation clustering. Unlike existing methods that retrieve experiences once per task, SLEA-RL retrieves at each decision step conditioned on the current observation, and clusters structurally similar observations for efficient retrieval and automatic cross-trajectory generalization.

* •

    Quality-controlled self-evolving experience library. We introduce score-based admission with rate-limited extraction that prevents degradation under continuous update pressure, enabling the experience library to co-evolve with the policy through semantic analysis rather than gradient updates.

* •

    Empirical validation on long-horizon benchmarks. SLEA-RL achieves strong results on ALFWorld, WebShop, and seven search-augmented QA tasks, outperforming many standard RL and experience-augmented baselines.

### 2.1 LLM Agent Framework

We consider an LLM agent operating in an interactive environment $\mathcal{E}$. At each timestep $t$, the agent observes a state $o_{t}\in\mathcal{O}$, selects an action $a_{t}\in\mathcal{A}$, and receives a reward $r_{t}$ and next observation $o_{t+1}$. A trajectory $\tau\=(o_{0},a_{0},r_{0},\ldots,o_{T},a_{T},r_{T})$ captures one episode of interaction. Tasks are specified by natural language descriptions $d$. An LLM-based agent parameterized by $\theta$ implements a policy $\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}|o_{\leq t},d,c)$ where $c$ represents additional context (e.g., retrieved experiences). Our goal is to learn a policy that maximizes expected return $\max_{\theta}\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\pi_{\theta}}\left[\sum_{t\=0}^{T}\gamma^{t}r_{t}\right]$ subject to context length constraints $|c|\leq L_{\max}$.
In many environments, the agent receives only a sparse terminal reward $R(\tau)\in{0,1}$ indicating task success or failure, with intermediate rewards $r_{t}\=0$ for all $t<T$. In this setting, the discounted return from step $t$ reduces to $\hat{R}_{t}\=\gamma^{T-t}R(\tau)$. Our framework accommodates both sparse and dense reward settings; we use $r_{t}$ in full generality and specialize where needed. This sparse reward structure makes step-level credit assignment particularly challenging, as the agent must determine which intermediate actions causally contributed to the final outcome across episodes spanning dozens of steps.

### 2.2 Group Relative Policy Optimization

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)*(Guo et al., [2025](#bib.bib9 "DeepSeek-r1: incentivizing reasoning capability in LLMs via reinforcement learning"))* is a reinforcement learning method that avoids training a critic by using intra-group relative rewards to optimize the policy. For each query $x$, the model samples $G$ responses ${y^{(1)},\ldots,y^{(G)}}$, which are scored to obtain rewards ${R^{(1)},\ldots,R^{(G)}}$, where $i\in[G]$ indexes the trajectory within the sampled group. GRPO computes normalized advantages and updates the policy with a PPO-style clipped objective*(Schulman et al., [2017](#bib.bib5 "Proximal policy optimization algorithms"))*:

|  |  | $\displaystyle\mathcal{J}_{\text{GRPO}}(\theta)\=\mathbb{E}_{x,{y^{(i)}}}\bigg[\frac{1}{G}\sum_{i\=1}^{G}\min\Big(\rho^{(i)}A^{(i)},$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | $\displaystyle\quad\text{clip}(\rho^{(i)},1!-!\epsilon,1!+!\epsilon)A^{(i)}\Big)-\beta D_{\text{KL}}(\pi_{\theta}\|\pi_{\text{ref}})\bigg],$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $\rho^{(i)}\=\frac{\pi_{\theta}(y^{(i)}|x)}{\pi_{\text{old}}(y^{(i)}|x)}$ is the importance ratio and $A^{(i)}\=\frac{R^{(i)}-\text{mean}({R^{(j)}}_{j\=1}^{G})}{\text{std}({R^{(j)}}_{j\=1}^{G})}$ is the normalized advantage, with $\epsilon$ and $\beta$ as hyperparameters, $\pi_{\text{old}}$ the policy before the current update, and $\pi_{\text{ref}}$ the reference policy for KL regularization. This formulation eliminates value network training while providing automatic baseline subtraction and variance normalization. A critical property for time efficiency is that sampling $G$ trajectories in parallel using modern inference engines incurs wall-clock time similar to sampling a single trajectory, making group-based methods highly practical.

3 SLEA-RL[Uncaptioned image][Uncaptioned image]
------------------------------------------------

We propose SLEA-RL, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that integrates step-level experience retrieval into agent training. The framework contains three interleaved components:
(i) Self-evolving experience library, which distills reusable strategies and warnings from successful and failed trajectories through quality-controlled semantic analysis.
(ii) Step-level observation clustering with cluster-indexed retrieval, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant past experiences.
(iii) Experience-augmented rollouts with policy optimization, where retrieved experiences are incorporated into the agent context during training to guide decision-making.

### 3.1 Experience Library

The experience library $E\=E^{+}\cup E^{-}$ is a structured repository of textual experiences accumulated during training. Each entry $e\in E$ is represented as a tuple $e\=(s_{e},l_{e},z_{e})$, where $s_{e}$ is a natural-language description of a strategy or warning, $l_{e}\in{\text{principle},\text{pattern},\text{example}}$ denotes its abstraction level, and $z_{e}\in\mathbb{R}$ is a quality score derived from the reward of the trajectory from which the experience is extracted.
The library is divided into two zones: a *strategy zone* $E^{+}$, which stores successful strategies organized hierarchically into principles, reasoning patterns, and concrete examples; and a *warning zone* $E^{-}$, which records failure knowledge such as common mistakes and recurring failure patterns. To control growth, the library capacity is limited to $C$ entries per level in each zone.

We use $\varepsilon_{t}\subset E$ to denote the subset of experiences retrieved at step $t$ for a given observation. The library evolves through semantic analysis rather than gradient updates (Section[3.4](#S3.SS4 "3.4 Self-Evolving Experience Library ‣ 3 SLEA-RL ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training")), providing interpretable knowledge structures that can be inspected and transferred across agents.

### 3.2 Step-level Observation Clustering

Next, we introduce the observation clustering mechanism to enable efficient experience retrieval and consistent step-level credit assignment. In multi-turn environments, many observations are semantically similar; clustering allows such states to share both advantages and retrieved experiences. Prior work groups similar observations for advantage normalization*(Feng et al., [2025](#bib.bib11 "Group-in-group policy optimization for LLM agent training"))*. SLEA-RL extends this idea by using the same structure to index reusable experiences.

We maintain a cluster index $\mathcal{C}\={c_{1},\ldots,c_{M}}$, where each cluster $c_{i}$ is represented by a prototype observation $\mathrm{rep}(c_{i})$ and stores associated experience pools $E^{+}_{c_{i}}\subseteq E^{+}$ and $E^{-}_{c_{i}}\subseteq E^{-}$. Given a new observation $o_{t}$, we assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one:

|  | $\displaystyle c(o_{t})\=\begin{cases}c_{i}\&\text{if }\exists\,c_{i}:\ \mathrm{sim}(o_{t},\mathrm{rep}(c_{i}))\geq\delta\\ \text{new cluster}\&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- |

where $\text{sim}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a sequence similarity function and $\delta$ is the similarity threshold.

If the assigned cluster already contains experiences, retrieval is performed directly from its pools:

|  | $\varepsilon_{t}\=\mathrm{TopK}!\left(E^{+}_{c(o_{t})},k^{+}\right)\cup\mathrm{TopK}!\left(E^{-}_{c(o_{t})},k^{-}\right),$ |  | (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $k^{+}$ and $k^{-}$ control the number of retrieved strategies and warnings. This cluster-indexed retrieval avoids scanning the full library while ensuring both positive and cautionary guidance.

If the cluster has no associated experiences, the method falls back to library-wide semantic retrieval:

|  | $\varepsilon_{t}\=\mathrm{TopK}!\left({e\in E:\mathrm{sim}(o_{t},e)>\delta},k\right),$ |  | (2) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

and the retrieved experiences are linked to the cluster for future reuse.

As training progresses, most observations match existing clusters, making retrieval increasingly efficient and targeted. During library evolution (Section[3.4](#S3.SS4 "3.4 Self-Evolving Experience Library ‣ 3 SLEA-RL ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training")), newly admitted experiences are associated with relevant clusters, while score-based admission replaces lower-quality entries, allowing cluster pools to improve alongside the policy.

### 3.3 Experience-Augmented Rollout

Building the observation clustering, SLEA-RL performs *step-level experience retrieval* during rollout. At step $t$ in a trajectory, the agent observes $o_{t}$ and retrieves relevant experiences $\varepsilon_{t}$ using the cluster-indexed mechanism (Eq.[1](#S3.E1 "In 3.2 Step-level Observation Clustering ‣ 3 SLEA-RL ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training")–[2](#S3.E2 "In 3.2 Step-level Observation Clustering ‣ 3 SLEA-RL ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training")). To avoid injecting low-quality experiences early in training, retrieval is activated only after a warmup of $W$ epochs and when the library size exceeds $|E|>C_{\min}$.

When retrieval is enabled, the policy conditions on both the current observation and retrieved experiences:

|  | $a_{t}\sim\pi_{\theta}(\cdot\mid\text{augment}(o_{t},\varepsilon_{t})),$ |  | (3) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where experiences are inserted into the prompt via format-preserving augmentation (Appendix[A](#A1 "Appendix A Format-Preserving Prompt Augmentation ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training")).

The key distinction from prior work*(Zhang et al., [2025](#bib.bib21 "RLEP: reinforcement learning with experience replay for llm reasoning"); Cai et al., [2025b](#bib.bib22 "Flex: continuous agent evolution via forward learning from experience"))* is that experience retrieval occurs *at every step* based on the current observation, rather than once from the initial task description. This design allows experience guidance to adapt to evolving agent states and ensures that the model learns to utilize retrieved experiences during training under the same conditions used at inference.

### 3.4 Self-Evolving Experience Library

The experience library evolves through *quality-controlled semantic analysis* rather than gradient updates. Naively extracting experiences from all trajectories would generate hundreds of candidates per step, causing eviction churn and unstable retrieval. SLEA-RL addresses this with three controls: outcome partitioning, selective extraction, and score-based admission.

#### Outcome partitioning.

After rollout, trajectories are split by reward. Let $r_{j}\=R(\tau_{j})$ denote the reward of trajectory $\tau_{j}$. Using a threshold $\eta$ (typically the batch median), we form

|  | $\displaystyle\mathcal{T}^{+}\={\tau_{j}:r_{j}>\eta},\quad\mathcal{T}^{-}\={\tau_{j}:r_{j}\leq\eta},$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- |

where successes provide strategy signals and failures reveal pitfalls.

#### Selective extraction.

Only the top-$K_{\text{traj}}$ trajectories from $\mathcal{T}^{+}$ and bottom-$K_{\text{traj}}$ from $\mathcal{T}^{-}$ are analyzed for experience extraction. An auxiliary LLM summarizes reusable strategies (from successes) or warnings (from failures). Each extracted experience inherits the episode reward of its source trajectory as its quality score $z_{e}\=R(\tau)$. To limit growth, each evolution step generates at most $K_{\text{strat}}$ strategies and $K_{\text{warn}}$ warnings.

#### Score-based admission.

Each library zone has capacity $C$. A candidate experience is admitted only if its quality score $z_{e}$ exceeds the lowest-scoring entry in that zone; otherwise it is discarded. As the policy improves, higher-reward trajectories yield higher-quality experiences that replace older ones, keeping the library aligned with the agent’s evolving capabilities. Accepted experiences are inserted into $E^{+}$ or $E^{-}$ and associated with relevant observation clusters.

### 3.5 Policy Optimization

SLEA-RL combines episode-level and step-level credit assignment. For each task, we sample $G$ trajectories with experience-augmented rollout and compute episode-level advantages following GRPO.
To provide fine-grained credit, we introduce *step-level advantages* based on observation clusters (Section[3.2](#S3.SS2 "3.2 Step-level Observation Clustering ‣ 3 SLEA-RL ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training")). For each cluster, we group steps with similar observations across trajectories and normalize their discounted returns within the group. This assigns different credit to actions taken under similar states but leading to different outcomes.
The final advantage is a weighted combination:

|  | $\hat{A}\=A_{\text{episode}}+w\cdot A_{\text{step}},$ |  | (4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $w$ controls the contribution of step-level credit. The policy is then optimized using the standard clipped GRPO objective with $\hat{A}$.
Importantly, SLEA-RL requires no additional loss terms or auxiliary passes: experience-guided learning arises directly from rollout, where retrieved experiences influence actions and are reinforced through their impact on returns.

Step-level advantages provide fine-grained credit at individual decision points. For each timestep $t$ across all $G$ trajectories, we assign the observation $o_{t}^{(i)}$ to its nearest cluster in the embedding space (Section[3.2](#S3.SS2 "3.2 Step-level Observation Clustering ‣ 3 SLEA-RL ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training")). Steps from different trajectories that map to the *same* cluster $c$ form a step-level group: these are decisions made under similar states but potentially leading to different outcomes. Formally, we collect all (action, discounted return) pairs from steps assigned to $c$ into $\mathcal{S}(c)\={(a_{t}^{(i)},\hat{R}_{t}^{(i)})\mid c(o_{t}^{(i)})\=c}$, where $\hat{R}_{t}^{(i)}\=\sum_{k\=t}^{T}\gamma^{k-t}r_{k}^{(i)}$ is the discounted return from step $t$, computed from per-step environment rewards $r_{k}^{(i)}$ (distinct from the episode-level reward $R^{(i)}\=R(\tau^{(i)})$). Within each such group, we normalize the discounted returns to obtain per-step advantages:

|  | $\displaystyle A_{\text{step}}(a_{t}^{(i)})\=\frac{\hat{R}_{t}^{(i)}-\text{mean}!\left({\hat{R}_{t}^{(j)}\mid(a_{t}^{(j)},\hat{R}_{t}^{(j)})\in\mathcal{S}(c)}\right)}{\text{std}!\left({\hat{R}_{t}^{(j)}\mid(a_{t}^{(j)},\hat{R}_{t}^{(j)})\in\mathcal{S}(c)}\right)}$ |  | (5) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Actions taken at the same observation cluster but leading to different outcomes receive different credit, enabling the policy to distinguish effective from ineffective decisions at each state. The combined advantage for each action $a_{t}^{(i)}$ is:

|  | $\hat{A}(a_{t}^{(i)})\=A_{\text{episode}}(\tau^{(i)})+w\cdot A_{\text{step}}(a_{t}^{(i)})$ |  | (6) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $w$ controls the relative weight of step-level credit assignment. The policy is updated using the clipped surrogate objective extended with the multi-level advantage:

|  | $\displaystyle\mathcal{J}(\theta)$ | $\displaystyle\=\mathbb{E}_{d,{\tau^{(i)}}}\bigg[\frac{1}{G}\sum_{i\=1}^{G}\frac{1}{T_{i}}\sum_{t\=1}^{T_{i}}$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | $\displaystyle\;\;\min!\Big(\rho_{t}^{(i)}\hat{A}_{t}^{(i)},\,\text{clip}(\rho_{t}^{(i)},1!-!\epsilon,1!+!\epsilon)\,\hat{A}_{t}^{(i)}\Big)$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | $\displaystyle\;\;-\beta\,D_{\text{KL}}(\pi_{\theta}\|\pi_{\text{ref}})\bigg],$ |  | (7) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $\rho_{t}^{(i)}\=\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}^{(i)}|o_{\leq t}^{(i)},d,\varepsilon_{t})}{\pi_{\text{old}}(a_{t}^{(i)}|o_{\leq t}^{(i)},d,\varepsilon_{t})}$ is the per-step importance ratio conditioned on the experience-augmented context.

4 Experiments
-------------

We present empirical evaluations of SLEA-RL across a variety of agentic tasks. Our experiments aim to answer the following questions: (1)How does SLEA-RL compare to state-of-the-art RL and experience-augmented baselines? (2)What is the contribution of each component (step-level retrieval, observation clustering, self-evolving library)? (3)How does step-level retrieval compare to task-level retrieval? (4)How does the experience library scale with training?

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

Benchmarks.We evaluate on two multi-turn agent benchmarks, ALFWorld *(Shridhar et al., [2021](#bib.bib24 "ALFWorld: Aligning Text and Embodied Environments for Interactive Learning"))* and WebShop *(Yao et al., [2022a](#bib.bib25 "Webshop: towards scalable real-world web interaction with grounded language agents"))*, as well as search-augmented QA tasks covering both single-hop and multi-hop settings. See Appendix A for details.

Baselines.For ALFWorld and WebShop, we compare against: (a)closed-source LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro); (b)prompt-based and memory methods that guide behavior via in-context reasoning or external memory without parameter updates (ReAct, Reflexion, Mem0, ExpeL, MemP, SimpleMem); (c)RL methods with trajectory-level or group-based advantage estimation (RLOO, GRPO, GiGPO, R3L, IGPO); and (d)experience-augmented RL that integrates persistent memory into the RL loop (MemRL, Mem0+GRPO, SimpleMem+GRPO, SkillRL). For search-augmented QA, we compare against R1-Instruct, Search-R1, ZeroSearch, StepSearch, EvolveR, and RL baselines PPO, Reinforce++, GSPO, and GiGPO.

Implementation details.We use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the primary base model, and additionally evaluate Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct to study scaling. RL training uses a learning rate of $1!\times!10^{-6}$, batch size 16, group size $G{\=}8$, and 4 gradient accumulation steps, with clipping $\epsilon{\=}0.2$ and KL coefficient $\beta{\=}0.01$. The step-level advantage weight is $w{\=}1.0$.

For the experience library, we set the similarity threshold $\delta{\=}0.85$, warmup $W{\=}5$ epochs, and retrieve top-$2$ strategies and top-$1$ warnings per step. Experience extraction and semantic analysis are performed by the same base model used for rollout, requiring no additional model deployment. Per-step retrieval adds minimal overhead: cluster-indexed lookup uses string similarity ($O(|\mathcal{C}|)$ comparisons) rather than neural embeddings, and the retrieved text is prepended to the existing prompt without additional forward passes. The main computational addition is the auxiliary LLM call for experience extraction, which runs once per training batch. For search-augmented QA, we follow the same setup as Search-R1, using E5 as the retriever with group size $G{\=}5$. Full details are provided in Appendix[D](#A4 "Appendix D Hyperparameter Configuration ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training").

### 4.2 Main Results

#### ALFWorld and WebShop.

Table[1](#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Search-augmented QA. ‣ 4.2 Main Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") reports results on ALFWorld and WebShop. SLEA-RL achieves 93.5% on ALFWorld and 76.3% on WebShop, consistently outperforming all baselines. Prompt-based methods plateau well below RL approaches (e.g., ExpeL at 46.3% on ALFWorld), highlighting the limits of in-context learning for distilling actionable knowledge. Compared to the strongest RL baseline GiGPO (90.8% ALFWorld, 72.8% WebShop), SLEA-RL shows gains that are particularly pronounced on harder subtasks requiring multi-step reasoning—Heat improves by 10.1% and Pick2 by 11.2%. Among experience-augmented RL methods, SLEA-RL outperforms SkillRL (+3.6% on both benchmarks), validating that step-level retrieval conditioned on the current observation provides more targeted guidance than task-level skill retrieval. The gains are consistent across model sizes: on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, SLEA-RL achieves 87.5% on ALFWorld and 75.4% on WebShop, with the WebShop improvement (+10.4% over GiGPO) suggesting that experience augmentation particularly benefits smaller models with less internalized knowledge.

#### Search-augmented QA.

Table[2](#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Search-augmented QA. ‣ 4.2 Main Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") shows results on search-augmented QA tasks. SLEA-RL achieves the best average score of 60.9%, outperforming the strongest baseline IGPO (58.7%). The gains are most apparent on multi-hop tasks requiring iterative information synthesis—SLEA-RL improves over IGPO by 2.3% on 2Wiki and 9.0% on MuSiQue (77.2 vs. 31.4)—indicating that step-level experiences effectively guide multi-step reasoning. Despite training on only NQ and HotpotQA, SLEA-RL generalizes well to out-of-domain benchmarks (81.8% on TriviaQA, 55.2% on PopQA). We note that IGPO achieves strong performance on Bamboogle (74.9%), where SLEA-RL (33.2%) lags behind; we attribute this to the dataset’s small size and distinctive reasoning patterns that favor IGPO’s information-theoretic grouping. Compared to SkillRL, which achieves the best PopQA performance (73.8%) through task-specific skill retrieval but degrades sharply on multi-hop tasks (20.2% on MuSiQue), SLEA-RL provides more balanced improvements across both single-hop and multi-hop settings.

### 4.3 Ablation Studies

#### Task-level vs. step-level retrieval.

Figure[3(a)](#S4.F3.sf1 "In Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") compares step-level retrieval (ours) with task-level retrieval, where experiences are retrieved once from the initial task and kept fixed. Step-level retrieval consistently outperforms task-level retrieval across all ALFWorld subtasks, with the largest gains on Look (+11.1%) and Pick2 (+4.4%), which require adapting to evolving states. On WebShop, it improves score (87.6 vs. 84.8) and success rate (76.3% vs. 72.0%). Both variants significantly outperform GRPO (77.6% on ALFWorld, 66.1% on WebShop), showing that experience augmentation is beneficial, while step-level conditioning provides additional gains. Methodology-wise, the task-level retrieval setting is equivalent to SkillRL.

#### Step-level advantage.

Figure[3(b)](#S4.F3.sf2 "In Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") evaluates the impact of step-level credit assignment by comparing $w{\=}1$ (full method) and $w{\=}0$ (episode-level only). Removing step-level advantage reduces ALFWorld performance from 93.5% to 87.8%, with larger drops on Look (85.1% $\to$ 77.8%) and Heat (93.8% $\to$ 86.5%), and lowers WebShop success from 76.3% to 70.8%.
While $w{\=}0$ still outperforms GRPO, step-level advantage provides additional gains (+5.7% on ALFWorld, +5.5% on WebShop), indicating that fine-grained credit assignment complements experience retrieval.

#### Experience library capacity.

Figure[4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ Step-level advantage. ‣ 4.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") studies the effect of the per-zone capacity $C$ (strategy and warning) on WebShop. Performance improves from $C{\=}25$ (84.5 / 71.8%) to $C{\=}100$ (87.6 / 76.3%), then slightly declines at $C{\=}200$ (87.1 / 75.6%). This suggests that overly large libraries admit lower-quality experiences that reduce retrieval precision. All settings outperform GRPO (79.3 / 66.1%), indicating robustness to $C$. We use $C{\=}100$ as the default choice.

#### Reinforcement learning for LLM agents.

RL has become the dominant paradigm for post-training of LLMs*(Schulman et al., [2017](#bib.bib5 "Proximal policy optimization algorithms"); Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib6 "Training a helpful and harmless assistant with reinforcement learning from human feedback"); Rafailov et al., [2023](#bib.bib7 "Direct preference optimization: your language model is secretly a reward model"))*, with recent work extending these techniques to multi-turn agentic settings. Group-based methods avoid training a separate critic: RLOO*(Ahmadian et al., [2024](#bib.bib8 "Back to basics: revisiting reinforce-style optimization for learning from human feedback in llms"))* uses leave-one-out baselines, GRPO*(Guo et al., [2025](#bib.bib9 "DeepSeek-r1: incentivizing reasoning capability in LLMs via reinforcement learning"))* computes group-relative advantages, and GSPO*(Zheng et al., [2025a](#bib.bib38 "Group sequence policy optimization"))* and Reinforce++*(Hu et al., [2025](#bib.bib39 "REINFORCE++: stabilizing critic-free policy optimization with global advantage normalization"))* further refine variance reduction. For multi-turn tasks, GiGPO*(Feng et al., [2025](#bib.bib11 "Group-in-group policy optimization for LLM agent training"))* provides step-level credit assignment by grouping similar observations, SPEAR*(Qin et al., [2025](#bib.bib14 "Learn the ropes, then trust the wins: self-imitation with progressive exploration for agentic reinforcement learning"))* employs self-imitation learning, Turn-PPO*(Li et al., [2025](#bib.bib17 "Turn-ppo: turn-level advantage estimation with ppo for improved multi-turn rl in agentic llms"))* applies per-turn optimization, R3L*(Shi et al., [2026](#bib.bib16 "R3L: reflect-then-retry reinforcement learning with language-guided exploration, pivotal credit, and positive amplification"))* introduces retrospective reward redistribution, and IGPO*(Wang et al., [2025](#bib.bib15 "Information gain-based policy optimization: a simple and effective approach for multi-turn llm agents"))* uses information-theoretic grouping.

#### Experience-augmented methods for LLM agents.

Retrieval-augmented generation*(Lewis et al., [2020](#bib.bib20 "Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks"))* enhances LLMs by conditioning on retrieved content. For agentic tasks, prompt-based methods such as ReAct*(Yao et al., [2022b](#bib.bib27 "ReAct: synergizing reasoning and acting in language models"))*, Reflexion*(Shinn et al., [2023](#bib.bib28 "Reflexion: language agents with verbal reinforcement learning"))*, and ExpeL*(Zhao et al., [2024](#bib.bib30 "Expel: LLM agents are experiential learners"))* leverage in-context reasoning or external memory without parameter updates, while Mem0*(Chhikara et al., [2025](#bib.bib29 "Mem0: building production-ready ai agents with scalable long-term memory"))*, MemP*(Fang et al., [2025](#bib.bib31 "Memp: exploring agent procedural memory"))*, and SimpleMem*(Liu et al., [2026](#bib.bib32 "SimpleMem: efficient lifelong memory for LLM agents"))* maintain persistent memory stores. Training-free experience-based approaches*(Cai et al., [2025a](#bib.bib23 "Training-free group relative policy optimization"), [b](#bib.bib22 "Flex: continuous agent evolution via forward learning from experience"))* achieve agent adaptation through semantically evolving experience libraries without gradient computation. More recently, methods integrating experience with RL training have emerged: *Zhang et al. ([2025](#bib.bib21 "RLEP: reinforcement learning with experience replay for llm reasoning"))* introduce experience replay during RL, MemRL*(Zhang et al., [2026](#bib.bib19 "Memrl: self-evolving agents via runtime reinforcement learning on episodic memory"))* couples memory updates with policy optimization, and SkillRL*(Xia et al., [2026](#bib.bib18 "SkillRL: evolving agents via recursive skill-augmented reinforcement learning"))* retrieves task-level skills to augment rollouts. However, these approaches retrieve experiences at the task level—once per episode based on the initial description—which becomes stale as observations evolve across steps. A more comprehensive discussion of baseline comparisons is provided in Appendix[G](#A7 "Appendix G Extended Related Work ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training").

6 Conclusion
------------

We propose SLEA-RL, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that integrates step-level experience retrieval with quality-controlled experience evolution. By combining a self-evolving experience library, cluster-indexed retrieval, and multi-level credit assignment, SLEA-RL enables agents to reuse and refine turn-level knowledge throughout training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines.

Limitations
-----------

SLEA-RL introduces additional computational overhead due to step-level experience retrieval and prompt augmentation at each decision step, increasing both training and inference cost compared to standard RL. The framework also relies on an external LLM for experience extraction, whose quality can affect the usefulness of the learned experience library; poor extraction may introduce noisy or suboptimal guidance. Moreover, maintaining and updating the experience library adds system complexity, and the benefits may depend on the quality and diversity of collected trajectories. Improving the efficiency and robustness of experience extraction and retrieval remains an important direction for future work.

Appendix A Format-Preserving Prompt Augmentation
-------------------------------------------------

A critical implementation detail concerns how retrieved experiences are incorporated into the prompt. Naively prepending experience text directly into the observation content disrupts the format the model expects, causing progressive degradation of valid action generation as the library grows. The policy $\pi_{\theta}$ is well-calibrated for observations in the expected clean format (i.e., the observation distribution $\mathcal{O}_{\text{clean}}$ seen during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning); when the observation is corrupted with arbitrary preamble text, the distribution shift increases with the length of the injected text, producing increasingly malformed actions.

SLEA-RL addresses this through format-preserving augmentation. When experiences $\varepsilon_{t}$ are available, the prompt is constructed as:

|  | $\text{augment}(o_{t},\varepsilon_{t})\=[\text{sys}(\varepsilon_{t}),\ \text{obs}(o_{t})]$ |  | (8) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $\text{sys}(\varepsilon_{t})$ places the retrieved strategies and warnings in the system role and $\text{obs}(o_{t})$ preserves the observation in the user role exactly as the model expects. This separation ensures that experience injection acts as a small perturbation to the policy rather than a format-breaking corruption. The experience text is constrained to a token budget $B_{\max}$ to avoid consuming excessive prompt context.

Appendix B Analysis: Step-Level vs. Task-Level Retrieval
----------------------------------------------------------

The experience library reduces uncertainty about optimal actions at each decision point. Letting $H(a^{*}_{t}\mid o_{t})$ denote the entropy of the optimal action distribution at step $t$ given observation $o_{t}$, access to relevant experiences $\varepsilon$ provides information gain:

|  | $I(a^{*}_{t};\varepsilon\mid o_{t})\=H(a^{*}_{t}\mid o_{t})-H(a^{*}_{t}\mid o_{t},\varepsilon)>0$ |  | (9) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The key distinction lies in what experiences are retrieved. Task-level retrieval conditions on the initial task description $d$, retrieving $\varepsilon_{\text{task}}\=\text{retrieve}(E,d)$ once for the entire episode. Step-level retrieval conditions on the current observation, retrieving $\varepsilon_{t}\=\text{retrieve}(E,o_{t})$ at each step. Since $o_{t}$ provides more specific context about the agent’s current situation than the initial task description, step-level retrieval is expected to yield more relevant experiences:

|  | $I(a^{*}_{t};\varepsilon_{t}\mid o_{t})\geq I(a^{*}_{t};\varepsilon_{\text{task}}\mid o_{t})$ |  | (10) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

This advantage becomes increasingly pronounced as the episode progresses and $o_{t}$ diverges from the initial context. By step 20 of a household navigation task, the agent’s current room and available objects bear little resemblance to the original goal specification, rendering task-level experiences increasingly irrelevant. We validate this hypothesis empirically through ablation studies comparing step-level, task-level, and hybrid retrieval modes.

Appendix C More About Benchmarks
--------------------------------

ALFWorld *(Shridhar et al., [2021](#bib.bib24 "ALFWorld: Aligning Text and Embodied Environments for Interactive Learning"))* is an embodied decision-making benchmark where agents must complete multi-step household tasks through textual interactions with a simulated environment. Tasks require long-horizon planning, state tracking, and grounding actions in partially observable settings.

WebShop *(Yao et al., [2022a](#bib.bib25 "Webshop: towards scalable real-world web interaction with grounded language agents"))* is a web-based interactive environment that evaluates agents in realistic online shopping scenarios. The agent navigates a simulated HTML interface to search for, filter, and purchase products based on natural language instructions. The environment contains over 1.1M products and 12K instructions, yielding a large and diverse action space.

We further evaluate on search-augmented QA tasks, which require agents to iteratively retrieve and reason over external information. These include single-hop datasets (NQ*(Kwiatkowski et al., [2019](#bib.bib44 "Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research"))*, TriviaQA*(Joshi et al., [2017](#bib.bib45 "TriviaQA: a large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension"))*, PopQA*(Mallen et al., [2023](#bib.bib46 "When not to trust language models: investigating effectiveness of parametric and non-parametric memories"))*), where answers can typically be found within a single document, and multi-hop datasets (HotpotQA*(Yang et al., [2018](#bib.bib47 "HotpotQA: a dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering"))*, 2Wiki*(Ho et al., [2020](#bib.bib48 "Constructing a multi-hop QA dataset for comprehensive evaluation of reasoning steps"))*, MuSiQue*(Trivedi et al., [2022](#bib.bib49 "MuSiQue: multihop questions via single-hop question composition"))*, Bamboogle*(Press et al., [2023](#bib.bib50 "Measuring and narrowing the compositionality gap in language models"))*), which require aggregating evidence across multiple sources. These benchmarks test both retrieval quality and multi-step reasoning.

SLEA-RL achieves higher success than GiGPO throughout training, with the gap widening as the experience library matures. Bottom row: mean episode length. SLEA-RL reduces episode length faster, indicating more efficient task completion via experience-guided action selection.*

#### Training episode success rate.

Figures[6(a)](#A5.F6.sf1 "In Figure 6 ‣ Appendix E Training curves. ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") and[6(b)](#A5.F6.sf2 "In Figure 6 ‣ Appendix E Training curves. ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") show the training episode success rate on ALFWorld and WebShop. On ALFWorld, SLEA-RL exhibits a steeper rise starting around step 60, reaching over 80% by step 130, while GiGPO trails by 10–15%. On WebShop, SLEA-RL pulls ahead around step 40 and reaches 70–75% success by step 140, compared to GiGPO’s 60%. The widening gap in the mid-to-late training regime confirms that experience retrieval provides increasingly useful guidance as the library accumulates higher-quality entries.

#### Episode length dynamics.

Figures[6(c)](#A5.F6.sf3 "In Figure 6 ‣ Appendix E Training curves. ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") and[6(d)](#A5.F6.sf4 "In Figure 6 ‣ Appendix E Training curves. ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") show the mean episode length. A decreasing length indicates more efficient task completion. On ALFWorld, both methods begin near 48 steps (the maximum); SLEA-RL drops below 20 by step 140 while GiGPO remains around 25–30, suggesting that retrieved strategies help the agent avoid unnecessary exploration. On WebShop, both converge to 5–6 steps, but SLEA-RL reaches this efficiency earlier, particularly in the mid-training regime (steps 30–80).

Appendix F System Prompts
-------------------------

Figure[7](#A6.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ Appendix F System Prompts ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training") presents the three system prompts used in the SLEA-RL pipeline. Prompt A is prepended to the agent’s observation at each step when experience retrieval is active, providing retrieved strategies and warnings via format-preserving augmentation (Section[A](#A1 "Appendix A Format-Preserving Prompt Augmentation ‣ SLEA-RL : Step-Level Experience Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Agentic Training")). Prompt B is used during the experience evolution phase to extract reusable strategies from successful trajectories, organized into three abstraction levels (principles, methods, and concrete examples). Prompt C performs analogous failure diagnosis on unsuccessful trajectories, identifying root causes and formulating actionable warnings. Together, these prompts enable semantic library evolution without gradient updates.


*Figure 7: System prompts used in the SLEA-RL pipeline. Prompt A augments each step’s observation with retrieved experiences. Prompt B extracts reusable strategies from successful trajectories into the strategy zone $E^{+}$. Prompt C diagnoses failures and populates the warning zone $E^{-}$. These prompts enable semantic library evolution without gradient updates.*

Appendix G Extended Related Work
--------------------------------

This section provides a more comprehensive discussion of the relationship between SLEA-RL and existing methods.

#### Comparison with SkillRL.

SkillRL*(Xia et al., [2026](#bib.bib18 "SkillRL: evolving agents via recursive skill-augmented reinforcement learning"))* is the most closely related experience-augmented RL method. It maintains a skill library of reusable strategies and retrieves relevant skills to augment the agent’s prompt during RL training. However, SkillRL operates at the *task level*: skills are retrieved once based on the initial task description and held constant throughout the episode. This design is adequate for tasks where the context remains stable, but becomes a limitation in multi-turn environments where the agent’s observation evolves at each step. For instance, in ALFWorld, the agent may begin in a kitchen but navigate to a bedroom mid-episode; task-level skills about “kitchen tasks” become irrelevant. SLEA-RL addresses this through step-level retrieval conditioned on the current observation $o_{t}$, ensuring that retrieved experiences remain relevant as the episode progresses. Additionally, SkillRL does not incorporate step-level credit assignment, relying solely on episode-level advantages. SLEA-RL combines step-level retrieval with GiGPO-style step-level advantage estimation, providing fine-grained credit that identifies which specific actions benefit from which experiences.

#### Comparison with MemRL.

MemRL*(Zhang et al., [2026](#bib.bib19 "Memrl: self-evolving agents via runtime reinforcement learning on episodic memory"))* integrates memory mechanisms directly into the RL optimization loop. Unlike SLEA-RL, which maintains an external experience library that evolves through semantic analysis, MemRL updates its memory bank through gradient-based optimization. While this approach allows end-to-end training, it conflates memory quality with policy quality—if the policy degrades, memory updates may also degrade. SLEA-RL decouples these concerns: the experience library evolves through quality-controlled semantic extraction (score-based admission, novelty checking), independent of gradient updates, providing more stable knowledge accumulation.

#### Comparison with prompt-based memory methods.

Methods such as Mem0*(Chhikara et al., [2025](#bib.bib29 "Mem0: building production-ready ai agents with scalable long-term memory"))*, ExpeL*(Zhao et al., [2024](#bib.bib30 "Expel: LLM agents are experiential learners"))*, MemP*(Fang et al., [2025](#bib.bib31 "Memp: exploring agent procedural memory"))*, and SimpleMem*(Liu et al., [2026](#bib.bib32 "SimpleMem: efficient lifelong memory for LLM agents"))* maintain external memory stores that guide agent behavior through in-context retrieval. These approaches operate without parameter updates, relying entirely on the base model’s ability to leverage retrieved context. While effective for rapid adaptation, they cannot fundamentally improve the policy’s decision-making capabilities. Hybrid approaches (Mem0+GRPO, SimpleMem+GRPO) combine memory with RL training but still retrieve at the task level. SLEA-RL differs by (i) performing step-level retrieval conditioned on the evolving observation, (ii) using quality-controlled library evolution with score-based admission rather than unconstrained memory accumulation, and (iii) integrating multi-level credit assignment that exploits the same observation clustering used for retrieval.

#### Comparison with search-augmented RL.

For search-augmented QA*(Kwiatkowski et al., [2019](#bib.bib44 "Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research"); Joshi et al., [2017](#bib.bib45 "TriviaQA: a large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension"); Mallen et al., [2023](#bib.bib46 "When not to trust language models: investigating effectiveness of parametric and non-parametric memories"); Yang et al., [2018](#bib.bib47 "HotpotQA: a dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering"); Ho et al., [2020](#bib.bib48 "Constructing a multi-hop QA dataset for comprehensive evaluation of reasoning steps"); Trivedi et al., [2022](#bib.bib49 "MuSiQue: multihop questions via single-hop question composition"); Press et al., [2023](#bib.bib50 "Measuring and narrowing the compositionality gap in language models"))*, Search-R1*(Jin et al., [2025](#bib.bib40 "Search-r1: training LLMs to reason and leverage search engines with reinforcement learning"))* trains agents to iteratively search and reason using RL with verifiable rewards. ZeroSearch*(Sun et al., [2025](#bib.bib41 "ZeroSearch: incentivize the search capability of LLMs without searching"))* and StepSearch*(Zheng et al., [2025b](#bib.bib42 "StepSearch: igniting LLMs search ability via step-wise proximal policy optimization"))* extend this paradigm with zero-shot and step-level search strategies, respectively. EvolveR*(Wu et al., [2025](#bib.bib33 "EvolveR: self-evolving LLM agents through an experience-driven lifecycle"))* introduces evolving retrieval during training. These methods focus on improving the retrieval component of the agent, whereas SLEA-RL augments the agent with accumulated *experiences*—distilled strategies and warnings from past episodes—providing complementary guidance that helps the agent reason more effectively over retrieved documents.

Appendix H Broader Impact and Potential Risks
---------------------------------------------

SLEA-RL improves the ability of agents to learn from accumulated experience, which can benefit applications requiring multi-step reasoning and decision-making, such as virtual assistants, scientific discovery, and automation. However, the framework may also amplify biases or errors present in the collected trajectories, as these are distilled into reusable experiences and reused across tasks. In addition, experience reuse could lead to over-reliance on past patterns, reducing adaptability in novel or adversarial settings. The increased computational cost of step-level retrieval may further limit accessibility. Careful curation of experience data, monitoring of failure cases, and efficiency improvements are important to mitigate these risks.
