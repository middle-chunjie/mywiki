###### Abstract

Agent skills, structured packages of procedural knowledge and executable resources that agents dynamically load at inference time, have become a reliable mechanism for augmenting LLM agents.
Yet inference-time skill augmentation is fundamentally limited: retrieval noise introduces irrelevant guidance, injected skill content imposes substantial token overhead, and the model never truly acquires the knowledge it merely follows.
We ask whether skills can instead be internalized into model parameters, enabling zero-shot autonomous behavior without any runtime skill retrieval.
We introduce Skill0, an in-context reinforcement learning framework designed for skill internalization. Skill0 introduces a training-time curriculum that begins with full skill context and progressively withdraws it. Skills are grouped offline by category and rendered with interaction history into a compact visual context, teaching he model tool invocation and multi-turn task completion.
A Dynamic Curriculum then evaluates each skill file’s on-policy helpfulness, retaining only those from which the current policy still benefits within a linearly decaying budget, until the agent operates in a fully zero-shot setting.
Extensive agentic experiments demonstrate that Skill0 achieves substantial improvements over the standard RL baseline (+9.7% for ALFWorld and +6.6% for Search-QA), while maintaining a highly efficient context of fewer than 0.5k tokens per step. Our code is available at [https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/SkillZero](https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/SkillZero "").

1 Introduction
--------------

“Skills at training, zero at inference.”

— Skill0

Large Language Models (LLMs)*(Guo et al., [2025b](#bib.bib2 "Deepseek-r1: incentivizing reasoning capability in llms via reinforcement learning"); Team et al., [2025](#bib.bib4 "Kimi k2: open agentic intelligence"); Yang et al., [2025](#bib.bib3 "Qwen3 technical report"); Comanici et al., [2025](#bib.bib8 "Gemini 2.5: pushing the frontier with advanced reasoning, multimodality, long context, and next generation agentic capabilities"); Team et al., [2026](#bib.bib39 "Longcat-flash-thinking-2601 technical report"))* have demonstrated strong decision-making capabilities across complex real-world tasks*(Shen et al., [2023](#bib.bib89 "Hugginggpt: solving ai tasks with chatgpt and its friends in hugging face"); Shi et al., [2025](#bib.bib7 "Tool learning in the wild: empowering language models as automatic tool agents"); He et al., [2025](#bib.bib81 "Vitabench: benchmarking llm agents with versatile interactive tasks in real-world applications"); Jimenez et al., [2023](#bib.bib12 "Swe-bench: can language models resolve real-world github issues?"))*.
With the emergence of agent scaffolds like Claude Code and OpenClaw, structured Agent Skills*(Xu and Yan, [2026](#bib.bib24 "Agent skills for large language models: architecture, acquisition, security, and the path forward"); Li et al., [2026a](#bib.bib25 "Organizing, orchestrating, and benchmarking agent skills at ecosystem scale"); He et al., [2026](#bib.bib32 "OpenClaw as language infrastructure: a case-centered survey of a public agent ecosystem in the wild"))* have become the standard mechanism for extending agent capabilities on specialized tasks.

*Figure 1: Comparison of (a) Skill Augmentation methods and (b) our Skill Internalization method.*

The prevailing paradigm is inference-time skill augmentation: relevant skills are retrieved from a skill bank and injected into the model’s context as natural language guidance at each step*(Li et al., [2026b](#bib.bib28 "SkillsBench: benchmarking how well agent skills work across diverse tasks"); Liang et al., [2026](#bib.bib31 "SkillNet: create, evaluate, and connect ai skills"))*. This approach has proven effective and is now well-established, with growing ecosystems of skill libraries, retrieval pipelines, and evolution mechanisms*(Xu and Yan, [2026](#bib.bib24 "Agent skills for large language models: architecture, acquisition, security, and the path forward"); Xia et al., [2026](#bib.bib18 "SkillRL: evolving agents via recursive skill-augmented reinforcement learning"))*.
Yet this practical success obscures a more fundamental limitation.
First, retrieval noise introduces irrelevant or misleading guidance that corrupts the agent’s context*(Yao et al., [2026a](#bib.bib82 "ToolACE-mcp: generalizing history-aware routing from mcp tools to the agent web"); Wang et al., [2026b](#bib.bib85 "AgentNoiseBench: benchmarking robustness of tool-using llm agents under noisy condition"))*.
Second, injected skill content imposes token overhead that compounds across multi-turn interactions, limiting scalability*(Liu et al., [2024](#bib.bib86 "Lost in the middle: how language models use long contexts"); Hsieh et al., [2024](#bib.bib87 "RULER: what’s the real context size of your long-context language models?"))*.
Third, and most critically, a model that follows skill descriptions in its prompt is executing skills, not learning them: competence resides in the context, not in the model*(Wang et al., [2025a](#bib.bib34 "Reinforcement learning for self-improving agent with skill library"); Han et al., [2026](#bib.bib88 "SWE-skills-bench: do agent skills actually help in real-world software engineering?"))*.

This observation suggests a different question: rather than asking how to better retrieve and inject skills, can skills be internalized into model parameters, rendering retrieval unnecessary at inference time?
Skill acquisition in humans follows a familiar progression: an explicit instruction phase gives way to an internalized phase in which the same behavior is executed autonomously from memory*(Anderson, [1982](#bib.bib84 "Acquisition of cognitive skill."); Yuan et al., [2025](#bib.bib83 "From ⁢f(x) and ⁢g(x) to ⁢f(⁢g(x)): llms learn new skills in rl by composing old ones"))*.
Inference-time skill augmentation permanently anchors agents in the first stage.
Reinforcement learning offers a natural path to the second, driving the agent to consolidate effective strategies as intrinsic policy rather than reading them from context*(Guo et al., [2025a](#bib.bib66 "Deepseek-r1: incentivizing reasoning capability in llms via reinforcement learning"); Shao et al., [2024](#bib.bib36 "Deepseekmath: pushing the limits of mathematical reasoning in open language models"))*.
Yet a naive application of RL fails in both directions: without skill context, the agent lacks the structured guidance necessary to learn complex multi-step behavior; with full skill context throughout, the model remains dependent on external knowledge it has never been required to internalize. What is needed is a training regime that starts with skills and ends without them, systematically transferring competence from context to parameters.

We propose Skill0, the first RL framework that formulates skill internalization as an explicit training objective. Skill0 realized this curriculum through In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL): skills are provided as in-context guidance during training rollouts but removed entirely at inference, so that RL optimization directly drives the transition from context-dependent execution to autonomous behavior. Concretely, skills are grouped offline by category and rendered with interaction history into a compact visual context, teaching the model tool invocation and multi-turn task completion. Dynamic Curriculum evaluates each skill file’s on-policy helpfulness by comparing agent performance with and without it on a matched validation sub-task. Skills are retained only where the current policy still benefits, and discarded otherwise, until the budget reaches zero and the agent operates without any skill context.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skill0 achieves substantial improvements over strong baselines like AgentOCR (+9.7% for ALFWorld and +6.6% for Search-QA), and competitive performance against skill-augmented methods like SkillRL. Notably, by eliminating skill reliance at inference time, Skill0 maintains
a highly efficient context of fewer than 0.5k tokens per step,
significantly reducing inference overhead without sacrificing task performance.

### 2.1 LLM Agents

Recent advancements in instruction-tuned LLMs have enabled autonomous agents
to operate across a wide range of dynamic, open-world environments,
including code generation*(Jimenez et al., [2023](#bib.bib12 "Swe-bench: can language models resolve real-world github issues?"); Wang et al., [2026a](#bib.bib62 "Code-a1: adversarial evolving of code llm and test llm via reinforcement learning"))*,
GUI automation*(Ye et al., [2025](#bib.bib63 "Mobile-agent-v3: fundamental agents for gui automation"); Liu et al., [2026b](#bib.bib64 "MemGUI-bench: benchmarking memory of mobile gui agents in dynamic environments"))*,
gameplay*(Shridhar et al., [2020](#bib.bib11 "Alfworld: aligning text and embodied environments for interactive learning"))*, and embodied control*(Wang et al., [2023](#bib.bib65 "Voyager: an open-ended embodied agent with large language models"))*.
With the recent development of reinforcement learning for LLMs*(Yu et al., [2025](#bib.bib80 "Dapo: an open-source llm reinforcement learning system at scale"); Zheng et al., [2025](#bib.bib90 "Group sequence policy optimization"); Yao et al., [2026b](#bib.bib73 "CoBA-rl: capability-oriented budget allocation for reinforcement learning in llms"); Chen et al., [2026](#bib.bib78 "Learning to self-verify makes language models better reasoners"))*, agentic RL has emerged as a crucial post-training recipe for equipping LLM agents with robust decision-making capabilities*(Lu et al., [2026](#bib.bib5 "Ui-r1: enhancing efficient action prediction of gui agents by reinforcement learning"), [2025](#bib.bib6 "Ui-s1: advancing gui automation via semi-online reinforcement learning"); Feng et al., [2025](#bib.bib61 "Group-in-group policy optimization for llm agent training"))*.

### 2.2 Agentic Skills

Early memory-based approaches store raw trajectories directly into external databases
during the sampling process, serving as references for experience replay*(Zhao et al., [2024](#bib.bib56 "Expel: llm agents are experiential learners"); Shinn et al., [2024](#bib.bib54 "Reflexion: language agents with verbal reinforcement learning, 2023"))*.
However, such raw trajectories are often lengthy, redundant, and noisy,
making direct injection into the context window inefficient*(Chhikara et al., [2025](#bib.bib55 "Mem0: building production-ready ai agents with scalable long-term memory"))*.
To address this limitation, a growing line of work has explored skills—reusable,
abstracted, and structured behavioral primitives distilled from historical
trajectories*(Xu and Yan, [2026](#bib.bib24 "Agent skills for large language models: architecture, acquisition, security, and the path forward"); Li et al., [2026a](#bib.bib25 "Organizing, orchestrating, and benchmarking agent skills at ecosystem scale"); He et al., [2026](#bib.bib32 "OpenClaw as language infrastructure: a case-centered survey of a public agent ecosystem in the wild"))*.
Skills serve as a form of episodic memory that agents can consult at decision
time*(Li et al., [2026b](#bib.bib28 "SkillsBench: benchmarking how well agent skills work across diverse tasks"); Liu et al., [2026a](#bib.bib27 "SELF-vla: a skill enhanced agentic vision-language-action framework for contact-rich disassembly"); Liang et al., [2026](#bib.bib31 "SkillNet: create, evaluate, and connect ai skills"))*,
and have further been shown to provide efficient guidance within reinforcement
learning frameworks*(Xia et al., [2026](#bib.bib18 "SkillRL: evolving agents via recursive skill-augmented reinforcement learning"); Wang et al., [2025a](#bib.bib34 "Reinforcement learning for self-improving agent with skill library"); Jiao et al., [2026](#bib.bib35 "Agentic proposing: enhancing large language model reasoning via compositional skill synthesis"))*.
Despite these advances, existing methods predominantly focus on skill extraction,
organization, and retrieval, leaving the question of whether skills can be internalized into model parameters largely unexplored.

3 Method: Skill0
----------------

### 3.1 Agent Loop

#### Task Definition.

We formulate agent automation as a sequential decision-making problem. Given a task instruction $I$, the agent generates a sequence of actions ${a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{T}}$ to complete the task. At each step $t$, the agent operates within a structured environment $\mathcal{E}$ (e.g., an online simulator or retrieval engine), which provides a textual observation $o_{t}$ describing the current environmental state. The agent then samples an action $a_{t}$ from policy $\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}|I,h_{t})$, where $\theta$ denotes model parameters and $h_{t}$ represents history up to time $t$.

|  | $h_{t}\={o_{1},o_{2},\ldots,o_{t}}$ |  | (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The environment $\mathcal{E}$ transitions to
the next state and returns the next observation $o_{t+1}\=\mathcal{E}(o_{t},a_{t})$. This rollout continues until the task is successfully completed or the max step threshold is reached.

#### Skill Management.

Following*Xia et al. ([2026](#bib.bib18 "SkillRL: evolving agents via recursive skill-augmented reinforcement learning"))*, we organize reusable behavioral knowledge
into a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, structured into two levels: (1) General skills capture universal strategic principles
applicable across all task types, such as exploration strategies and
goal-tracking heuristics. (2) Task-specific skills store specialized knowledge
for task category $k$, including domain-specific action sequences and preconditions.

Skills are organized in a directory structure ‘‘skills/{task_name}/{skill_category}.md’’,
where each Markdown file $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ stores a group of related skills
sharing the same task and skill category
(e.g., ‘‘skills/search/entity_attribute_lookup.md’’).
The complete library $\texttt{SkillBank}\={\mathcal{S}_{k}}_{k\=1}^{N}$
thus contains $N$ such files in total. During training, rather than retrieving individual skills via semantic similarity,
we select a subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\texttt{SkillBank}$ of $m$ skill files
ranked by an on-policy helpfulness criterion, which estimates the learning
utility of each $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ to the current policy $\pi_{\theta}$
(detailed in Section[3.3](#S3.SS3 "3.3 Adaptive Curriculum Learning ‣ 3 Method: Skill0 ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization")).
at the current training stage.

#### Context Rendering.

When expanding to more domains,
token costs become a key challenge
with both the accumulated retrieved skills and interaction history.
Inspired by*Feng et al. ([2026](#bib.bib37 "AgentOCR: reimagining agent history via optical self-compression"))* and *Shi et al. ([2026](#bib.bib38 "MemOCR: layout-aware visual memory for efficient long-horizon reasoning"))*, we introduce a context rendering mechanism that maps the textual interaction context
(including history $h_{t}$ and retrieved skills $\mathcal{S}$) to a compact RGB image. Given compression ratio $c_{t}$, the rendered image is encoded
and compressed by the vision encoder Enc into visual representations:

|  | $\mathcal{V}_{t}\=\texttt{Enc}(h_{t},\mathcal{S};\,c_{t})$ |  | (2) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $\mathcal{V}_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$ serves as the compressed visual context
embedding fed into the policy, significantly reducing token overhead while
preserving the structural information necessary for decision-making.
Rather than treating the compression ratio $c_{t}\in(0,1]$ as a fixed
hyperparameter, we allow the policy to self-generate $c_{t}$ at each
step alongside the task action $a_{t}$:

|  | $(a_{t},\,c_{t})\sim\pi_{\theta}(a_{t},c_{t}\mid I,\mathcal{V}_{t})$ |  | (3) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### 3.2 In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL)

Skill0 introduces In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL), which combines
the sample efficiency and inductive bias of skill prompting with the exploration
capability of reinforcement learning. Through a dynamic online curriculum
(Section[3.3](#S3.SS3 "3.3 Adaptive Curriculum Learning ‣ 3 Method: Skill0 ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization")), skills are progressively internalized
into the model’s parameters, eliminating the need for explicit skill retrieval at inference time.

To incentivize both efficient context compression and skill internalization within
the agent loop, we introduce a composite reward following*Feng et al. ([2026](#bib.bib37 "AgentOCR: reimagining agent history via optical self-compression"))*,
which jointly optimizes task success and compression efficiency.
Let $\mathcal{I}_{\text{succ}}(\tau)\in{0,1}$ denote the binary success indicator
for trajectory $\tau$; the composite reward is defined as:

|  | $r^{\text{comp}}_{t}\=\begin{cases}\ln(c_{t}),\&\text{if }\mathcal{I}_{\text{succ}}(\tau)\=1,\\ 0,\&\text{otherwise},\end{cases}\qquad\tilde{r}_{t}\=r_{t}+\lambda\cdot r^{\text{comp}}_{t}$ |  | (4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $c_{t}\in(0,1]$ is the compression ratio at step $t$,
and the logarithmic formulation reflects the diminishing marginal returns
of higher compression. $r_{t}$ evaluates whether the agent completes the task correctly with skill enhancements at step $t$, and $\lambda\geq 0$ controls the trade-off between task performance
and compression efficiency.

For each query $q\sim\mathcal{D}$, $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$
samples a group of $G$ trajectories ${\tau_{i}}_{i\=1}^{G}$.
The training objective is:

|  | $\mathcal{L}_{\textsc{Skill0}}(\theta)\=\;\mathbb{E}_{\tau_{i}\sim\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(q),\,q\sim\mathcal{D}}\frac{1}{\sum_{i\=1}^{G}|\tau_{i}|}\sum_{i\=1}^{G}\sum_{t\=1}^{|\tau_{i}|}\text{clip}(r_{i,t}(\theta),\,A_{i},\,\epsilon)-\beta\cdot\mathbb{D}_{\text{KL}}[\pi_{\theta}\|\pi_{\text{ref}}]$ |  | (5) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where the advantage $A_{i}$ is computed by normalizing the total rewards
${\tilde{r}(\tau_{i})}_{i\=1}^{G}$ within the sampled group,
and $r_{i,t}(\theta)\={\pi_{\theta}(\tau_{i,t}\mid q,\tau_{i,<t})}/{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\tau_{i,t}\mid q,\tau_{i,<t})}$
is the importance sampling ratio.

### 3.3 Adaptive Curriculum Learning

As training progresses, the reliance on external skills undergoes a controlled annealing process to avoid abrupt distribution shifts in the context space. We formulate this curriculum as a linear decay of the skill budget $M^{(s)}$ at each stage $s\in{1,\dots,N_{S}}$:

|  | $|\mathcal{S}^{(s)}|\leq M^{(s)}\=\left\lceil N\cdot\frac{N_{S}-s}{N_{S}-1}\right\rceil$ |  | (6) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

This linear decay bounds the step-wise reduction of the skill context to $M^{(s)}-M^{(s+1)}\approx\frac{N}{N_{S}-1}$. By constraining changes to the active skill set $\mathcal{S}^{(s)}$, we strictly limit the deviation in the rendered visual context $\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s)}\=\texttt{Enc}(h_{t},\mathcal{S}^{(s)};c_{t})$. This ensures the distribution shift of the policy $\pi_{\theta}(a_{t},c_{t}\mid I,\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s)})$ remains smooth and stable, safely transitioning the agent to a fully self-reliant state ($\mathcal{S}^{(N_{S})}\=\emptyset$).

Based on above design, our curriculum operates in two phases: (a) an offline Relevance-Driven Skill Grouping that associates each skill file
$\mathcal{S}_{k}$ with a dedicated validation sub-task; and (b) an online Helpfulness-Driven Dynamic Curriculum that adaptively selects the active
skill subset $\mathcal{S}$ based on the current policy’s learning state during training process.

#### (a) Relevance-Driven Skill Grouping.

We define the relevance between a validation sub-task and a skill file
$\mathcal{S}_{k}$ as whether the sub-task’s domain and objective align with the
skill category encoded in $\mathcal{S}_{k}$.
Based on this relevance, we partition the validation set (subtracted from training dataset) into $N$ sub-tasks
${\mathcal{T}_{k}}_{k\=1}^{N}$ prior to training, where $\mathcal{T}_{k}$ groups
all validation instances whose skill requirements correspond to $\mathcal{S}_{k}$.
This offline grouping ensures each $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ has a dedicated sub-task
for evaluating its utility, forming the structural basis for the subsequent
dynamic curriculum.

#### (b) Helpfulness-Driven Dynamic Curriculum.

We split training process into $N_{S}$ progressive stages
with a decreasing skill budget $M$ ($|M|\=N_{S}$),
gradually reducing the agent’s reliance on external skill guidance until it
operates without any retrieved skills.
We quantify the helpfulness metric $\Delta_{k}$ of each
skill file $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ to the current policy $\pi_{\theta}$ by evaluating
$\mathcal{T}_{k}$ under two conditions: with $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ provided
(w/ skill) and without it (w/o skill) per $d$ training steps.
For stage $s$, we Filter, Rank, and Select top-$m$ ($m\leq M^{(s)}$) files from the active skill pool by $\Delta_{k}$ (see Algorithm[3.3](#S3.SS3 "3.3 Adaptive Curriculum Learning ‣ 3 Method: Skill0 ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization")).

### 4.1 Experiment Setup

#### Benchmarks

We evaluate our methods on ALFWorld*(Shridhar et al., [2020](#bib.bib11 "Alfworld: aligning text and embodied environments for interactive learning"))* and Search-based QA*(Jin et al., [2025](#bib.bib20 "Search-r1: training llms to reason and leverage search engines with reinforcement learning"))*. ALFWorld is a text-based game aligned with the ALFRED embodied AI benchmark, including 3,827 task instances across six categories of common household activities: Pick and Place (Pick), Look at Obj in Light (Look), Pick Clean then Place in Recep (Clean), Pick Heat then Place in Recep (Heat), Pick Cool then Place in Recep (Cool), and Pick Two Obj and Place (Pick2). Search-based QA contains several widely-used search-augmented QA benchmarks, including single-hop QA datasets (NQ*(Kwiatkowski et al., [2019](#bib.bib41 "Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research"))*, TriviaQA*(Joshi et al., [2017](#bib.bib42 "Triviaqa: a large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension"))*, and PopQA*(Mallen et al., [2023](#bib.bib43 "When not to trust language models: investigating effectiveness of parametric and non-parametric memories"))*) and multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA*(Yang et al., [2018](#bib.bib44 "HotpotQA: a dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering"))*, 2Wiki*(Ho et al., [2020](#bib.bib45 "Constructing a multi-hop qa dataset for comprehensive evaluation of reasoning steps"))*, MuSiQue*(Trivedi et al., [2022](#bib.bib46 "MuSiQue: multi-hop questions via single-hop question composition"))*, and Bamboogle*(Press et al., [2023](#bib.bib47 "Measuring and narrowing the compositionality gap in language models"))*).

#### Baselines.

We first compare Skill0 with in-context skills prompting methods (with text and OCR-based history) and RL-based methods (GRPO*(Shao et al., [2024](#bib.bib36 "Deepseekmath: pushing the limits of mathematical reasoning in open language models"))*, AgentOCR*(Feng et al., [2026](#bib.bib37 "AgentOCR: reimagining agent history via optical self-compression"))*, EvolveR*(Wu et al., [2025](#bib.bib48 "Evolver: self-evolving llm agents through an experience-driven lifecycle"))*, and SkillRL*(Xia et al., [2026](#bib.bib18 "SkillRL: evolving agents via recursive skill-augmented reinforcement learning"))*) across both benchmarks in Table[1](#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization"). For ALFWorld only (as shown in Table[5](#A4.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Appendix D More Comparisons ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization")), we additionally report prompt-based agentic or memory-based methods, including ReAct*(Yao et al., [2022](#bib.bib10 "React: synergizing reasoning and acting in language models"))* and Reflexion*(Shinn et al., [2024](#bib.bib54 "Reflexion: language agents with verbal reinforcement learning, 2023"))*, as well as Mem0*(Chhikara et al., [2025](#bib.bib55 "Mem0: building production-ready ai agents with scalable long-term memory"))*, ExpeL*(Zhao et al., [2024](#bib.bib56 "Expel: llm agents are experiential learners"))*, MemP*(Fang et al., [2025](#bib.bib57 "Memp: exploring agent procedural memory"))*, MemRL*(Zhang et al., [2026](#bib.bib58 "Memrl: self-evolving agents via runtime reinforcement learning on episodic memory"))*, and SimpleMem*(Liu et al., [2026c](#bib.bib59 "SimpleMem: efficient lifelong memory for llm agents"))*. For search-augmented QA (as shown in Table[6](#A4.T6 "Table 6 ‣ Appendix D More Comparisons ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization")), we include Search-o1*(Li et al., [2025](#bib.bib49 "Search-o1: agentic search-enhanced large reasoning models"))*, Search-R1*(Jin et al., [2025](#bib.bib20 "Search-r1: training llms to reason and leverage search engines with reinforcement learning"))*, ZeroSearch*(Sun et al., [2025](#bib.bib50 "Zerosearch: incentivize the search capability of llms without searching"))*, O2-Searcher*(Mei et al., [2025](#bib.bib53 "O2-searcher: a searching-based agent model for open-domain open-ended question answering"))*, ParallelSearch*(Zhao et al., [2025](#bib.bib52 "Parallelsearch: train your llms to decompose query and search sub-queries in parallel with reinforcement learning"))* and StepSearch*(Wang et al., [2025b](#bib.bib51 "Stepsearch: igniting llms search ability via step-wise proximal policy optimization"))*. Some closed-source models are also included, such as GPT-4o*(Hurst et al., [2024](#bib.bib40 "Gpt-4o system card"))* and Gemini-2.5-Pro*(Comanici et al., [2025](#bib.bib8 "Gemini 2.5: pushing the frontier with advanced reasoning, multimodality, long context, and next generation agentic capabilities"))*.

#### Implementation details.

We train the Qwen2.5-VL series using Skill0 for at most 180 steps on 4 H800 GPUs.
For ALFWorld, we adopt the training data split from GiGPO*(Feng et al., [2025](#bib.bib61 "Group-in-group policy optimization for llm agent training"))*,
with each batch sampling 16 tasks and 8 rollouts per prompt,
and a maximum prompt length of 3,072 tokens.
For Search-QA, we follow the experimental setup of Search-R1*(Jin et al., [2025](#bib.bib20 "Search-r1: training llms to reason and leverage search engines with reinforcement learning"))*,
using E5*(Wang et al., [2022](#bib.bib60 "Text embeddings by weakly-supervised contrastive pre-training"))* as the retriever.
The training data are drawn from NQ and HotpotQA, making these two benchmarks in-domain,
while the remaining datasets serve as out-of-domain evaluation.
Each batch samples 128 tasks with a maximum prompt length of 4,096 tokens.
For the curriculum learning schedule, we set the validation subset size to 1,000,
the number of curriculum stages to $N_{S}\=3$,
and initialize SkillBank from SkillRL*(Xia et al., [2026](#bib.bib18 "SkillRL: evolving agents via recursive skill-augmented reinforcement learning"))* for both environments.

### 4.2 Main Results

#### Method Performance.

As shown in Table [1](#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization"), Skill0 demonstrates exceptional performance across both ALFWorld and Search-QA. While introducing explicit skill prompts (Few-Shot) brings moderate improvements over Zero-Shot baselines, the gains are limited, indicating that LLMs struggle to fully leverage skill descriptions without sufficient exploration. In contrast, without external skill prompting during inference, Skill0 (3B) achieves an average success rate of 87.9 on ALFWorld and 40.8 on Search-QA, outperforming AgentOCR by +9.7 and +6.6 respectively. Based on 7B models, it delivers scores of 89.8 on ALFWorld and 44.4 on Search-QA, substantially outperforming other RL-based methods such as EvolveR, AgentOCR and GRPO. Furthermore, Skill0 achieves competitive or even stronger performance against skill-augmented methods like SkillRL. These consistent gains over both zero-shot and skill-augmented baselines demonstrate that our approach successfully internalizes complex reasoning and tool-use behaviors into the model’s parameters.

Table[5](#A4.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Appendix D More Comparisons ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") and Table[6](#A4.T6 "Table 6 ‣ Appendix D More Comparisons ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") provide broader comparisons: On ALFWorld, Skill0 (89.8) largely outperforms memory-augmented learning methods, including ExpeL (46.3), Mem0 (54.7), and MemRL (21.4). On Search-based QA, Skill0 (44.4) likewise surpasses search-based methods like Search-R1 (38.5), ZeroSearch (39.1), and EvolveR (43.1), further highlighting its performance.

Token Efficiency. Beyond strong task performance, Skill0 achieves these results with a substantially lower context token cost. Due to visual context modeling and skill internalization, Skill0 fundamentally maintains an ultra-low average token cost per step. For instance, using 3B models, it consumes only 0.38k tokens per step on ALFWorld and 0.18k on Search-QA. This is a massive reduction compared to text-based or skill-augmented method like SkillRL, which costs 2.21k and 0.87k tokens per step respectively (more than 5× higher).

(b) Performance comparison between Skill0 and AgentOCR, both evaluated without skill augmentation. (c) Performance comparison of Skill0 (OCR) against GRPO (Text) and SkillRL (Text), all evaluated without skill augmentation.*

#### Reward.

Throughout RL optimization, Skill0 maintains consistently higher reward curves on both the 3B and 7B backbones compared to the AgentOCR baseline, as illustrated in Figure[4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Training Dynamics ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") and[4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Training Dynamics ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization").

#### Method Comparison.

We further monitor validation accuracy over the course of training in Figure[5](#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 4.3 Training Dynamics ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization"). (a) demonstrates that when validated *with* skill augmentation, the model achieves faster early-stage performance improvement; while validation *without* skill prompts yields lower initial performance, it gradually catches up toward the end of optimization, revealing a clear trend of skill internalization. To further validate this observation, (b) evaluates models *without* skill prompts at inference time under a strictly fair comparison setting: Skill0 still outperforms AgentOCR, confirming that the performance advantage stems from internalized knowledge rather than reliance on explicit skill descriptions. For a broader comparison, (c) contrasts Skill0 against standard text-based RL baselines under the same skill-free inference protocol. Unlike GRPO and SkillRL, which plateau relatively early in training, Skill0 continues to improve steadily throughout optimization, ultimately achieving the highest performance upper bound among all compared methods. We also provide subtask dynamics of Skill0 in Appendix[B](#A2 "Appendix B More Training Dynamics ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") to further support it.

#### Helpfulness.

Figure[6](#S4.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ Helpfulness. ‣ 4.3 Training Dynamics ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") illustrates that the helpfulness of skills exhibits a consistent *rise-then-fall* pattern across all sub-tasks
throughout training. In the early stages, helpfulness remains low, as the
policy has not yet learned to leverage skill prompts via direct in-context prompting. As training progresses, the policy gradually learns to ground its
actions in the provided skill context, leading to a steady increase in helpfulness. In the later stages, the dynamic curriculum progressively
reduces the skill budget, compelling the policy to internalize skill knowledge
into its parameters rather than relying on external prompts; consequently,
$\Delta_{k}$ converges back toward zero. This characteristic trajectory empirically
validates the synergistic working mechanism of ICRL and curriculum learning,
demonstrating that skills serve as effective yet transient scaffolding during
policy optimization.

*Figure 8: Ablations of skill budget during training process.*

### 4.4 Ablations

#### Skill Budget $M$.

Given $N_{S}$ as 3, the Skill Budget $M$ for ALFWorld is calculated as $[6,3,0]$ (and $[5,3,0]$ for Search-QA) according to Algorithm[3.3](#S3.SS3 "3.3 Adaptive Curriculum Learning ‣ 3 Method: Skill0 ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization").
This design enforces a hard upper bound that gradually anneals the number of available skills across curriculum stages, compelling the model to actively and flexibly prune less helpful skills within the Budget, thereby progressively internalizing skill knowledge. To validate the effectiveness of this design, we compare our $[6,3,0]$ against other budgets ($[6,6,6],[3,3,3]$, and $[0,0,0]$) as well as a Fixed Full setting (without filter). Figure[8](#S4.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ Helpfulness. ‣ 4.3 Training Dynamics ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") highlights our superior skill internalization: while Fixed Full and $[6,6,6]$ collapse by -12.3 and -13.3 when skill prompts are removed, our method even achieves a +1.6 gain. Training dynamics in Figure[8](#S4.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ Helpfulness. ‣ 4.3 Training Dynamics ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization")(a) show that a static low budget ($[3,3,3]$) limits early exploration, leading to unstable learning and lower peaks. Conversely, Figure[8](#S4.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ Helpfulness. ‣ 4.3 Training Dynamics ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization")(b) demonstrates that our curriculum strategy consistently outperforms Fixed Full in skill-free inference settings, likely due to the training-inference gap and the skill over-reliance induced by maintaining a constant full skill set throughout training.

#### Dynamic Curriculum.

Table[3](#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Validation Interval 𝑑. ‣ 4.4 Ablations ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") validates the necessity of our three-step helpfulness-driven strategy (Filter \& Rank \& Select) (Algorithm[3.3](#S3.SS3 "3.3 Adaptive Curriculum Learning ‣ 3 Method: Skill0 ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization"), Step 1-3). It achieves the highest performance (87.9% w/o $\mathcal{S}$) and is the only setting to show a positive transfer ($\Delta\=+1.6\%$) when skill prompts are removed at inference. In contrast, simply using all skills up to the budget (“w/o Filter”) introduces context noise that drops performance by $2.7\%$. Worse, selecting skills randomly (“w/o Rank”) causes a severe collapse ($\Delta\=-13.7\%$, dropping to 62.9%), proving that retaining strictly helpful skills is essential for stable policy learning and preventing superficial prompt dependency.

#### Validation Interval $d$.

Table[3](#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Validation Interval 𝑑. ‣ 4.4 Ablations ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") explores the impact of the validation interval $d$ used for helpfulness evaluation. While a smaller interval ($d\=5$) provides marginal gains on Search-QA, it incurs significantly higher computational overhead. We select $d\=10$ as the optimal trade-off, balancing high task performance with training efficiency.

We also provide more detailed ablation results in Table[4](#A3.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Appendix C Ablation Details ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") to demonstrate our careful design.

*Table 2: Ablations of Dynamic Skill Curriculum on ALFWorld in different inference settings.*

| Method | w/ $\mathcal{S}$ | w/o $\mathcal{S}$ | $\Delta$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Filter \& Rank \& Select | 86.3 | 87.9 | $\uparrow$1.6 |
| w/o Filter | 81.6 | 78.9 | $\downarrow$2.7 |
| w/o Rank | 76.6 | 62.9 | $\downarrow$13.7 |

| $d$ | ALFWorld | Search-QA |

| 10 | 87.9 | 48.9 |
| 5 | 87.5 | 49.6 |
| 20 | 78.1 | 42.3 |

5 Conclusion
------------

In this work, we proposed Skill0, an in-context reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes agent skills directly into model parameters via a Dynamic Curriculum mechanism, eliminating external skill reliance at inference time.
Extensive experiments across ALFWorld and Search-QA demonstrate substantial improvements
over RL baselines (+9.7 and +6.6, respectively) with fewer than 0.5k tokens per step,
establishing skill internalization as a principled alternative to the retrieve-then-prompt paradigm. We believe Skill0 establishes skill internalization as a new principled and
scalable paradigm,
paving the way from tool-augmented toward truly autonomous LLM agents and self-sufficient intelligence.

#### Limitations.

Skill0 relies
on the quality of the initial SkillBank, and the offline relevance-driven
skill grouping requires re-partitioning when applied to new task domains.

Appendix A Theoretical Analysis
-------------------------------

Between two stages $s$ and $s+1$, for constants $L_{E},L_{\pi}>0$:

|  | $\displaystyle\|\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s+1)}-\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s)}\|\leq L_{E}\,|\mathcal{S}^{(s)}\setminus\mathcal{S}^{(s+1)}|,$ |  | (7) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | $\displaystyle\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}!\left[\pi_{\theta}(\cdot\mid I,\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s)})\;\middle\|\;\pi_{\theta}(\cdot\mid I,\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s+1)})\right]\leq L_{\pi}\,\|\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s+1)}-\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s)}\|.$ |  | (8) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Under the linear budget schedule

|  | $M^{(s)}\=\left\lceil N\cdot\frac{N_{S}-s}{N_{S}-1}\right\rceil,$ |  | (9) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

the following bounds hold:

|  | $\displaystyle\bigl\|\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s+1)}-\mathcal{V}_{t}^{(s)}\bigr\|$ | $\displaystyle\leq L_{E}\left\lceil\frac{N}{N_{S}-1}\right\rceil$ |  | (10) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | $\displaystyle\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}!\left(\pi_{\theta}^{(s)}\,\|\,\pi_{\theta}^{(s+1)}\right)$ | $\displaystyle\leq L_{\pi}L_{E}\left\lceil\frac{N}{N_{S}-1}\right\rceil$ |  | (11) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

At each stage transition, the linear decay ensures $M^{(s)}-M^{(s+1)}$ is uniformly bounded,
so substituting into the smoothness assumptions directly yields the result;
this piecewise stationarity stabilizes PPO importance ratios by preventing abrupt distributional shifts.

Under the budget constraint $|\mathcal{S}|\leq M^{(s)}$, if the utility admits a locally additive approximation:

|  | $J(\mathcal{S})-J(\emptyset)\approx\sum_{\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\mathcal{S}}\Delta_{k},$ |  | (12) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

then the rule

|  | $\mathcal{S}^{*(s)}\=\underset{\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{S}^{+},\;|\mathcal{S}|\leq M^{(s)}}{\arg\max}\sum_{\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\mathcal{S}}\Delta_{k},\qquad\mathcal{S}^{+}:\={\mathcal{S}_{k}:\Delta_{k}>0}$ |  | (13) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

is locally optimal under the above approximation, since discarding $\Delta_{k}\leq 0$ skills and greedily selecting the top-$M^{(s)}$ remainder maximizes the additive objective. During training, internalized skills naturally decrease to 0 and are filtered out automatically, yielding a self-paced curriculum.

Appendix B More Training Dynamics
---------------------------------

Figure[9](#A2.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ Appendix B More Training Dynamics ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") and Figure[10](#A2.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ Appendix B More Training Dynamics ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") present the per-subtask training dynamics of Skill0 (Qwen2.5VL-3B)
with and without skill context.
Across both ALFWorld and Search-QA, the w/ skill result consistently
achieves faster early-stage performance improvement.
The skill-free result yields lower initial performance and gradually catches up toward the end of optimization, mirroring
the skill internalization trend observed in Figure[5](#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 4.3 Training Dynamics ‣ 4 Experiment ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization").
These fine-grained per-subtask dynamics further confirm that the progressive annealing of skills
drives the model to internalize task-relevant knowledge into its parameters.

Appendix E Implementation Details
---------------------------------

We follow the rendering configurations in *Feng et al. ([2026](#bib.bib37 "AgentOCR: reimagining agent history via optical self-compression"))* to construct the visual context
in Skill0 for each benchmark, with the full prompts shown in Figure[11](#A5.F11 "Figure 11 ‣ Appendix E Implementation Details ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") and Figure[12](#A5.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ Appendix E Implementation Details ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization").
Text is rendered in a monospace font with a line spacing of 1.2 across both environments,
with a font size of 10pt and a maximum width of 392px for ALFWorld,
and 12pt with 560px for Search-QA.
To enable visual disambiguation of different context components,
we apply a semantic color coding scheme: task instructions and general context
are rendered in black, while for ALFWorld, observations are highlighted in blue and actions in red;
for Search-QA, the same convention is applied to <search> queries
and <information> results, respectively,
allowing the vision encoder to clearly distinguish between
perceived states, executed actions, and retrieved content at a glance. Table[7](#A5.T7 "Table 7 ‣ Appendix E Implementation Details ‣ Skill0: In-Context Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Skill Internalization") presents representative examples of the skill files
stored in SkillBank, illustrating the structured procedural knowledge
provided to the agent across both ALFWorld and Search-QA task categories.

| Skill Title | Principle (Actionable Pattern) | When to Apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| skills/ALFWorld/general.md | | |
| Systematic Exploration | Search every plausible surface or container exactly once before revisiting; prioritize unseen locations. | Anytime the goal count is not met and unexplored areas remain. |
| Immediate Acquisition | As soon as a required object becomes visible and reachable, take it immediately before moving elsewhere. | Upon first visual confirmation of a goal-relevant object. |
| skills/ALFWorld/pick_and_place.md | | |
| Grab When Seen | Whenever a needed object is visible and reachable, immediately take it before moving elsewhere. | Upon first sight of an unheld object matching the goal specification. |
| Place Before More Search | When holding a goal object and the target location is known, navigate there and place it immediately. | While carrying a required object and the destination has been identified. |
| skills/ALFWorld/look_at_obj_in_light.md | | |
| Switch Lamp On | Issue the use desklamp command as soon as you reach it so the light condition is satisfied. | Upon arriving at a desklamp that is currently off. |
| Grab Target First | If the target is visible but the desklamp is not, take the target immediately to carry it to the lamp. | When the target is visible and not yet held, while desklamp location is unknown. |
| skills/ALFWorld/clean.md | | |
| Phase-Ordered Plan | Execute in fixed sequence: (1) locate \& acquire, (2) clean at sink, (3) navigate, (4) place. | As soon as the goal specifies the object must be clean before placement. |
| Sink First for Cleaning | Upon holding the target, go straight to the nearest sink and issue the clean command. | Once the target is in hand and its required state is clean. |
| skills/ALFWorld/heat.md | | |
| Secure Exact Target First | Identify and pick up the exact object named in the goal before interacting with the microwave. | After spotting any candidate object, before opening or using appliances. |
| Open Then Heat | Upon reaching the microwave with the target in hand, open the door, place the object, then heat. | Immediately after navigating to the microwave with the target object held. |
| skills/ALFWorld/cool.md | | |
| Prep Cooling Appliance | Locate the fridge first and open it so it is ready before or immediately after grabbing the target. | As soon as the fridge comes into view or right after acquiring the target object. |
| Enforce Cooling Before Placement | Do not place the target object in its final location until a cooling action has been successfully executed. | When holding the correct object and before any placement action is attempted. |
| skills/Search/general.md | | |
| Decompose Then Search | Break the question into minimal sub-questions and handle each with its own targeted query before synthesizing. | Any complex or multi-hop question requiring multiple intermediate facts. |
| Exit When Evidence Is Solid | Stop issuing further queries once clear, corroborated evidence is found; avoid premature termination. | After each read step—answer only if confidence is justified, otherwise refine search. |
| skills/Search/direct_retrieval.md | | |
| Isolate Core Query | Strip the question to its key entity plus sought fact and search exactly that pair first. | At the start of any direct-retrieval task. |
| Evidence-Bound Answer | Only state an answer explicitly supported by retrieved text; continue searching rather than guess. | Before finalizing any factoid answer. |
| skills/Search/multi_hop_reasoning.md | | |
| Targeted Sequential Searches | Issue separate, focused searches for each sub-question instead of one broad query. | After decomposition, when distinct pieces of information must be collected individually. |
| Collect-Then-Compare | Retrieve concrete values for all items before performing any comparison or conclusion. | For comparative tasks involving dates, places, or quantitative attributes. |
