###### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a widely-used tool for information seeking, but their generated outputs are prone to hallucination. In this work, our aim is to allow LLMs to generate text with citations,
improving their factual correctness and verifiability.
Existing work mainly relies on commercial search engines and human evaluation, making it challenging to reproduce and compare different modeling approaches.
We propose ALCE, the first benchmark for Automatic LLMs’ Citation Evaluation.
ALCE collects a diverse set of questions and retrieval corpora
and requires building end-to-end systems to retrieve supporting evidence and generate answers with citations.
We develop automatic metrics along three dimensions—fluency, correctness, and citation quality—and
demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgements.
Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs and novel prompting strategies show that current systems have considerable room for improvement—For example, on the ELI5 dataset,
even the best models lack complete citation support 50% of the time.
Our analyses further highlight promising future directions, including
developing better retrievers,
advancing long-context LLMs,
and improving the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources.111Our code and data are available at [https://github.com/princeton-nlp/ALCE](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/ALCE "").

1 Introduction
--------------

Large language models (LLMs; *Brown et al., [2020](#bib.bib4 ""); OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib29 "")*) have gained increasing popularity as a tool for information seeking.
While they generate engaging and coherent responses,
their outputs are prone to hallucination and often contain factually incorrect information*Ji et al. ([2023](#bib.bib15 ""))*.
This makes it harder for users to trust and verify LLM-generated outputs without any supporting evidence.

*Figure 1: The task setup of ALCE. Given a question,
the system generates text while providing citing passages from a large retrieval corpus. Each statement may contain multiple citations (e.g., [1][2]).*

In this work, we study a new generation paradigm for LLMs, in which
we require LLMs to provide citations to one or a few text passages for any statement they generate (Figure[1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).
Incorporating citations brings several benefits:
(1) users can easily verify LLMs’ claims with the provided citations;
(2) LLMs can generate text that faithfully follows cited passages, which has the promise to improve correctness and alleviate hallucination.

| Dataset | Corpus (#passages) | Question type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASQA | Wikipedia (21M) | Factoid (ambiguous) | Q: When did the US break away from England? |
|  |  |  | A: The US declared independence on July 2, 1776 [1][2] … The Treaty of Paris was later signed on September 3, 1783 [3]. |
| QAMPARI | Wikipedia (21M) | Factoid (list) | Q: Which films have Gong Li as a member of their cast? |
|  |  |  | A: The Story of Qiu Ju [1], Farewell My Concubine [2], The Monkey King 2 [3], Mulan [3], Saturday Fiction [3] … |
| ELI5 | Sphere (899M) | Why/How/What | Q: How do student loans affect getting a mortgage? |
|  |  |  | A: Student loans can affect the debt to income ratio [1], which is a key factor in determining the amount that … [2][3] |

*Table 1: The three datasets used in our ALCE benchmark. These datasets cover a wide range of question types
and the corresponding corpora span from Wikipedia to
Web-scale document collection.*

Multiple commercial systems have adopted this paradigm: Bing Chat222<https://www.bing.com/new> and perplexity.ai333<https://www.perplexity.ai> respond to user questions in natural language with references to Web pages. *Nakano et al. ([2021](#bib.bib27 "")); Menick et al. ([2022](#bib.bib25 ""))* share a similar motivation, but they mainly experiment with commercial search engines and closed-source models, making their results difficult to evaluate.
Retrieval-augmented LMs*(Borgeaud et al., [2022](#bib.bib2 ""); Izacard et al., [2022](#bib.bib14 ""))* incorporate retrieved passages during both training and inference,
but do not guarantee faithfulness to retrieved passages or explicitly provide citations.
Additionally,
previous studies mostly rely on human evaluation*Nakano et al. ([2021](#bib.bib27 "")); Menick et al. ([2022](#bib.bib25 "")); Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24 ""))*, which is expensive and difficult to reproduce.
We argue that the absence of automated evaluation
hinders the advances of such systems.

We present ALCE, the first reproducible benchmark for automatically evaluating LLMs’ generations with citations.
ALCE assumes a natural-language question and a retrieval corpus, and requires building end-to-end systems to retrieve relevant passages from the corpus, generate a response to the question, and cite corresponding supporting passages.
We compile three datasets that cover different types of questions and corpora—ASQA*Stelmakh et al. ([2022](#bib.bib44 ""))*, QAMPARI*Rubin et al. ([2022](#bib.bib39 ""))*, and ELI5*Fan et al. ([2019](#bib.bib6 ""))*—as shown in Table[1](#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").
Different from previous benchmarks*(Lee et al., [2019](#bib.bib23 ""); Bohnet et al., [2022](#bib.bib1 ""))*,
ALCE evaluates long-text generation,
focusing on automatically evaluating citation quality,
and allows citing multiple passages for individual statements.

We design automatic evaluation methods in three dimensions: fluency, correctness, and citation quality.
Specifically,
we use MAUVE*(Pillutla et al., [2021](#bib.bib34 ""))* to measure fluency,
propose tailored correctness metrics for each dataset, and
adopt a natural language inference (NLI) model*(Honovich et al., [2022](#bib.bib12 ""))* to measure citation quality.
We showcase how the three dimensions together contribute to a robust evaluation,
preventing systems from exploiting shortcuts. Additionally, we conduct human evaluation and demonstrate a strong correlation with our automatic metrics.

We experiment on multiple systems with state-of-the-art LLMs and retrievers and also propose novel prompting strategies to synthesize retrieved text into text generation.
Although all systems are capable of providing fluent and coherent responses,
there remains substantial room for improvement in terms of correctness and citation quality: For example, on the ELI5 dataset,
around 50% generations of our ChatGPT and GPT-4 baselines are not fully supported by the cited passages.
Additionally, we find that
(1) a closed-book model (generating answers without accessing any retrieved documents) with post-hoc citing achieves good correctness but much worse citation quality;
(2) although interactive retrieval approaches*(Yao et al., [2023](#bib.bib51 ""); Schick et al., [2023](#bib.bib40 ""))* offer more flexibility in when/what to retrieve, they do not improve the performance on this challenging benchmark;
(3) summarizing the retrieved passages in a shorter text improves correctness but not citation quality;
(4) reranking multiple generations boosts citation quality measured by human evaluation;
(5) incorporating more retrieved passages in context does not help ChatGPT but improves GPT-4 performance.

Our extensive analyses
highlight three major challenges of building LLMs to generate text with citations:
(1)
the retrieval quality is crucial to the final performance and has substantial room for improvement;
(2)
LLMs’ limited context window
restricts the number of passages they can incorporate;
(3)
current LLMs struggle to synthesize multiple documents in context
without being distracted by irrelevant ones, although better instruction tuning brings significant improvement.
These challenges pose promising research directions for
developing better systems integrating retrieval and LLMs.

2 Task Setup and Datasets
-------------------------

Our task is formalized as follows:
Given a query $q$ and a corpus of text passages $\mathcal{D}$,
the system is required to return an output $\mathcal{S}$, which consists of $n$ statements $s_{1}$, …, $s_{n}$,
and each statement $s_{i}$ cites a list of passages $\mathcal{C}_{i}\={c_{i,1},c_{i,2},\ldots}$444In practice, we allow at most 3 citations for each statement as more citations usually do not help., where $c_{i,j}\in\mathcal{D}$.
In this work,
we segment LLMs’ output into statements by sentence boundaries.555QAMPARI requires a list as the answer, and we choose each entity in the generated list as a statement. While LLMs may include sentences that do not require a citation, such as “I’m happy to help”,
we observe that almost all sentences that LLMs output provide valuable information and require citations, similar to findings in *Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24 ""))*.
In this work, citations are enclosed by box brackets such as [1][2].

We divide the corpus $\mathcal{D}$ into 100-word passages following previous works on open-domain question answering*Karpukhin et al. ([2020](#bib.bib18 "")); Petroni et al. ([2021](#bib.bib32 "")); Piktus et al. ([2021](#bib.bib33 ""))*,
in contrast to
commercial systems like Bing Chat, which cite entire Web pages. We take 100-word passages because
it is easier for humans to verify, and allows for more retrieved passages to fit in LLMs’ limited context.

We choose QA datasets so that
(1) they contain factual questions, in which references are important;
(2) questions require long-text answers that cover multiple aspects; (3) answering the questions requires synthesizing multiple sources.
We select three datasets (Table[1](#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")) and introduce them below. See §[B](#A2 "Appendix B Dataset Statistics ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") for additional statistics.

ASQA *Stelmakh et al. ([2022](#bib.bib44 ""))* is a long-form factoid dataset.
As shown in Figure[1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"),
each question is an ambiguous question from AmbigQA*Min et al. ([2020](#bib.bib26 ""))* that requires multiple short answers to cover different aspects,
and the dataset provides a long-form answer that covers all short answers.
Since most questions can be answered by Wikipedia, we use the 2018-12-20 Wikipedia snapshot as $\mathcal{D}$.

QAMPARI *Rubin et al. ([2022](#bib.bib39 ""))* is a factoid QA dataset constructed from Wikipedia,
where the answer is a list of entities that are drawn from different passages.
Same as ASQA, we use the 2018-12-20 Wikipedia as the corpus.

ELI5 *Fan et al. ([2019](#bib.bib6 ""))* is a long-form QA dataset built on the Reddit forum “Explain Like I’m Five”.666<https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/> Most ELI5 questions are how/why/what questions that require long answers and multiple passages as evidence.
Due to the diverse topics discussed in the questions, we use
Sphere*Piktus et al. ([2021](#bib.bib33 ""))*—a filtered version of Common Crawl777<https://commoncrawl.org>. We also filter out any Web pages from Reddit. —as the corpus. The ELI5 dataset is widely used in related work due to its challenging nature*Nakano et al. ([2021](#bib.bib27 "")); Menick et al. ([2022](#bib.bib25 "")); Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24 ""))*.

We randomly select 1,000 examples from the development set of each dataset for ALCE.
Our benchmark primarily assesses the citation capabilities of existing LLMs and does not provide training data,
as
there are no available examples that provide supervision for citations
in these datasets.

3 Automatic Evaluation
----------------------

Our benchmark measures the following three dimensions of system responses:

* •

    Fluency: whether the model’s generated text is fluent and coherent.

* •

    Correctness: whether the answer is accurate and covers all aspects of interest.

* •

    Citation quality: whether the answer is well supported by the cited passages and no irrelevant passages are cited.

In the following, we present automatic metrics for each dimension
and discuss why the combination of the three metrics provides a robust evaluation.

### 3.1 Fluency

We use MAUVE *Pillutla et al. ([2021](#bib.bib34 ""))* to evaluate the fluency of the output (§[C](#A3 "Appendix C Implementation Details ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).
We deploy MAUVE for ASQA and ELI5
and omit it for QAMPARI,
as QAMPARI
only requires a list of short answers as the response
and LLMs consistently adhere to the format in our experiments.
As MAUVE is sensitive to output length and text style, and most LLMs are capable of producing fluent text,
we mainly employ it as a sanity check as long as the MAUVE scores are high enough.

### 3.2 Correctness

Our objective is to measure the informativeness and utility of the generation to the question. *Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24 ""))* propose to directly evaluate perceived utility by humans, a process difficult to automate.
Therefore, we use correctness—whether the response is accurate compared to a ground truth answer—as a proxy.
Evaluating the correctness of long-form generation is a challenging task*(Krishna et al., [2021](#bib.bib21 ""))*,
and we describe our strategy for each dataset below.
Figure[2](#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Correctness ‣ 3 Automatic Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") illustrates the metrics and we include additional implementation details in §[C](#A3 "Appendix C Implementation Details ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").

For ASQA, we follow *Stelmakh et al. ([2022](#bib.bib44 ""))* and
calculate the recall of correct short answers
by checking whether the short answers (provided by the dataset) are exact substrings of the generation (exact match recall; EM recall).

For QAMPARI, we follow *Rubin et al. ([2022](#bib.bib39 ""))* and calculate the precision and recall of
the model prediction,
by checking the exact match to the gold answer list.
We add one additional adjustment:
considering that users often want to know only a few example answers of
the question, our evaluation considers recall to be 100% if the prediction includes at least 5 correct answers (recall-5).

Unlike ASQA and QAMPARI, the ELI5 dataset does not provide short entity answers. *Fan et al. ([2019](#bib.bib6 ""))* use ROUGE for evaluation, which does not reflect the correctness well (*Krishna et al., [2021](#bib.bib21 "")*; §[A](#A1 "Appendix A Generating Claims for ELI5 ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).
Inspired by works in summarization evaluation*Zhang and Bansal ([2021](#bib.bib53 "")); Kamoi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib17 "")); Wang et al. ([2020](#bib.bib49 ""))*,
we use InstructGPT (text-davinci-003; *Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib30 "")*) to generate three “sub-claims”.
Then we use TRUE888<https://huggingface.co/google/t5_xxl_true_nli_mixture>. Details in §[C](#A3 "Appendix C Implementation Details ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"). *Honovich et al. ([2022](#bib.bib12 ""))*, a T5-11B*(Raffel et al., [2020](#bib.bib36 ""))* model fine-tuned on a collection of natural language inference (NLI) datasets, to check whether the model output entails the sub-claims (claim recall). TRUE targets factual correctness and has been used by previous works in similar context*(Bohnet et al., [2022](#bib.bib1 ""); Gao et al., [2023](#bib.bib8 ""))*.
We demonstrate that claim recall provides a more accurate measure of correctness than existing metrics (more details in §[A](#A1 "Appendix A Generating Claims for ELI5 ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).

<img src='x2.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='433' height='522' />

*Figure 2: Evaluation of correctness (details in §[3.2](#S3.SS2 "3.2 Correctness ‣ 3 Automatic Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).*

### 3.3 Citation Quality

We evaluate citation qualities using two metrics:
(1) citation recall, which determines if the output is entirely supported by cited passages, and
(2) citation precision, which identifies any irrelevant citations. Although we prioritize citation recall as it entails a well-supported and truthful answer,
enhancing precision is crucial for better user satisfaction,
reducing the need for human review of extraneous passages.
Figure[3](#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Citation Quality ‣ 3 Automatic Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") provides an illustrated example.

<img src='x3.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='452' height='528' />

*Figure 3: Evaluation of citation quality (details in §[3.3](#S3.SS3 "3.3 Citation Quality ‣ 3 Automatic Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")). We use
an NLI model to verify whether a statement is supported by its citations.*

We use the NLI model TRUE*(Honovich et al., [2022](#bib.bib12 ""))* again
to automatically examine whether the cited passages entail the model generation.
We conduct human evaluation (§[6](#S6 "6 Human Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")) to demonstrate strong human correlation of our metric.

#### Citation recall.

We calculate the citation recall of each statement (0 or 1) and average
over all statements in the model response. For each statement $s_{i}$, its citation recall is $1$ if and only if there is at least one citation ($\mathcal{C}_{i}\neq\emptyset$) and
$\phi(\text{concat}(\mathcal{C}_{i}),s_{i})\=1$,
where
$\phi(\text{premise},\text{hypothesis})$
is the NLI model that outputs $1$ if the premise entails the hypothesis, and <!-- MathML: <math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.7.m7.1"><semantics id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.7.m7.1a"><mn id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml">0</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.7.m7.1b"><cn id="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" type="integer" xref="S3.SS3.SSS0.Px1.p1.7.m7.1.1">0</cn></annotation-xml></semantics></math> -->00 otherwise;
$\text{concat}(\mathcal{C}_{i})$ concatenates all passages in $\mathcal{C}_{i}$ together (details in §[C](#A3 "Appendix C Implementation Details ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).
The NLI evaluation is in accordance with the attributable to identified sources (AIS) framework*Rashkin et al. ([2023](#bib.bib38 ""))*:
$\phi(\text{concat}(\mathcal{C}_{i}),s_{i})\=1$ implies that
$s_{i}$ is true based solely on $\text{concat}(\mathcal{C}_{i})$.

#### Citation precision.

Our citation precision evaluation detects citations that are irrelevant,
but it does not require citing a minimal set.
We follow this design because human writing often cites redundant sources to enhance credibility;
human readers may also appreciate multiple citations, especially when it pertains to critical claims such as medical advice.

We calculate the citation precision for each citation (0 or 1) and
average over all citations in the response. We first define if a citation is “irrelevant”.
Intuitively, a citation $c_{i,j}$ is “irrelevant” if (a) $c_{i,j}$ itself cannot support $s_{i}$ and (b) removing $c_{i,j}$ does not affect the rest of the citations to support $s_{i}$. Formally, $c_{i,j}$ is “irrelevant” if and only if

1. (a)

    $\phi(c_{i,j},s_{i})\=0$, AND

2. (b)

    $\phi(\text{concat}(\mathcal{C}_{i}\setminus{c_{i,j}}),s_{i})\=1$.

$c_{i,j}$ has a precision of 1 if $s_{i}$ has recall$\=$$1$ and $c_{i,j}$ is not irrelevant.
For example (Figure[3](#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Citation Quality ‣ 3 Automatic Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")), when $s_{3}$ cites three references [2][4][5] and recall$\=$$1$, [2] is “irrelevant” if $\phi(\texttt{[2]},s_{3})\=0$ and $\phi(\texttt{[4][5]},s_{3})\=1$.
For condition (b) to work, we set recall$\=$$1$ as a prerequisite for precision$\=1$. Note that this algorithm overlooks the scenario when one citation partially supports the statement.
We discuss the details in §[E](#A5 "Appendix E Citation Recall Discussion ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").

### 3.4 ALCE is Robust to Shortcut Cases

We showcase how the ALCE evaluation is robust to two possible shortcuts in §[D](#A4 "Appendix D ALCE Catches Shortcut Cases ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"):
(1) using the top-1 retrieved passage as the response and citing itself,
and (2) using the first two sentences of the top-1 passage.
Both cases have almost-perfect citation scores, but (1) has low fluency due to its unnaturally long length compared to human answers, and (2) has low correctness due to low coverage.

4 Modeling
----------

In this section,
we discuss three major modeling components for an ALCE system—retrieval, synthesis, and post-editing.

| Instruction: Write an accurate, engaging, and concise answer for ... |
| --- |
|  |
| <Retrieve for the question> |
| Document [1](Title: American Decolonization) ... |
| Document [2](Title: Decolonization) ... |
| Document [3](Title: American Revolution) ... |
| ... |
|  |
| Question: When did US break away from England? |
| Answer:  The United States took the first step towards gaining independence ... [1][2]. The Treaty of Paris was later signed ... [3]. |

*Table 2:  An example of our Vanilla method. Different colors represent prompt,  model generation, and  <actions>.
We also provide two in-context demonstrations before the test example.*

### 4.1 Retrieval

We explore simple, off-the-shelf retrievers.
We use dense retrievers for Wikipedia, including GTR*Ni et al. ([2022](#bib.bib28 ""))* and DPR*Karpukhin et al. ([2020](#bib.bib18 ""))*;
we use
BM25 for Sphere. For each question,
we
retrieve the top-100 passages.

### 4.2 Synthesis

We focus on how to
prompt an LLM to
interact with the retriever, and
synthesize and cite the evidence (without fine-tuning internal parameters).
One noteworthy challenge is that existing LLMs all have limited context window and thus
can only fit a handful of passages.

#### Vanilla.

We simply provide the model with the top-$k$999We can fit at most $k\=3$ for models with 2K window and at most $k\=5$ for models with 4K context window. passages and instruct the model to cite accordingly (Table[2](#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 4 Modeling ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).
We also use in-context learning*Brown et al. ([2020](#bib.bib4 ""))* and prepend two demonstrations.
The complete instruction is in Table[23](#A8.T23 "Table 23 ‣ Appendix H Prompts ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").

#### Summ/Snippet.

With a 4K context window, we can at most safely fit $k\=5$ passages. As shown in Figure[4](#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Comparison of Different LLMs ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"), top-5 retrieved passages can only cover 56.8% percent of the answers in ASQA.

To tackle this limitation, we propose to provide summaries or snippets of passages instead of the full text (summaries are abstractive but snippets are spans from passages).
We acquire summaries and snippets by prompting ChatGPT with instructions (prompts in Table[25](#A8.T25 "Table 25 ‣ Appendix H Prompts ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") and [26](#A8.T26 "Table 26 ‣ Appendix H Prompts ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).101010We also query ChatGPT whether the passage is relevant to the question, and
filter out passages that are “irrelevant”. Then we replace all passages with summaries/snippets.
Summaries or snippets significantly reduce the passage length, allowing for more passages to fit in:
for ASQA, they reduce passage length by 6$\times$ on average.

Though Summ/Snippet allows for more retrieved passages,
they are lossy compressions.
To alleviate this problem,
we propose Interact, an interactive prompting scheme
to allow the model to check the full text of certain passages. At each step, the model can execute one of three actions:
(1) “Check: Document [1][2]” to check the full text of the corresponding documents;
(2) “Output:” to output a statement of the answer;
(3) “End.” to end the generation.
§[C](#A3 "Appendix C Implementation Details ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") provides more details.

| Instruction: ... |
| --- |
|  |
| <Retrieve for question ‘‘...’’> |
| Question: When did US break away from England? |
| Search: Declaration of Independence |
| <Search the query among the top-100 passages> |
| Document [1](Title: ...) ... |
| Output: The United States ... [1]. |
| <Remove Document [1] from context> |
| Search: Treaty of Paris |
| <Search the query among the top-100 passages> |
| Document [3](Title: ...) ... |
| Output: The Treaty of Paris ... [3]. |
| <Remove Document [3] from context> |
| End. |

*Table 3:  An example of InlineSearch.*

#### InlineSearch.

The above methods all display retrieval results at the beginning.
In InlineSearch,
we allow LLMs to call “search” during the generation process*(Yao et al., [2023](#bib.bib51 ""); Press et al., [2022](#bib.bib35 ""); Jiang et al., [2023](#bib.bib16 ""))*.
At each step, the model can execute one of three actions:
“Search: {query}” to search among the top-100 passages111111We do not search over the entire corpus because {query} may leave out certain context in the question and searching among the already-retrieved passages gives better results. by using GTR; the “Output” and “End” actions are the same as Interact.
For each “Search” action, we display the best retrieved passage in the context.
The passage is removed after one action to save context space.
Table[3](#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Summ/Snippet. ‣ 4.2 Synthesis ‣ 4 Modeling ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") shows an example.

#### ClosedBook.

We also add a simple closed-book baseline, where the model is only prompted with the instruction and the question,
without any retrieved passages provided.
Consequently, this variant does not cite any evidences.

### 4.3 Post-editing

In this section we discuss two strategies for refining the output to further improve its quality.

#### Rerank.

We randomly sample $n_{\text{sample}}\=4$ responses for each question, and select the best response using the automatic citation recall score.
we expect Rerank to improve the citation quality.

#### PostCite.

For each statement, we find the best matching passage among the top-100 retrieved passages using GTR and cite it.
We combine this with ClosedBook in our experiments.

We describe experiment details in §[C](#A3 "Appendix C Implementation Details ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").
We use ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0301) with a 4K context window for most main experiments and ablations.
We also report results with ChatGPT-16K (gpt- 3.5-turbo-16k-0613) and GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613; 8K context window).
For open-source models, we test LLaMA*(Touvron et al., [2023a](#bib.bib47 ""))* and
its instruction-tuned versions, including
Alpaca*(Taori et al., [2023](#bib.bib45 ""))*, Vicuna*(Chiang et al., [2023](#bib.bib5 ""))*, and Oasst*(Köpf et al., [2023](#bib.bib22 ""))*.
They all have a 2K context window.
We use short instructions for LLaMA (Table[24](#A8.T24 "Table 24 ‣ Appendix H Prompts ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")) to save context budget.
Additionally, we test LLaMA-2-Chat, which were also trained to follow instructions *Touvron et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib48 ""))*. These models have a context window of 4K tokens, which allows for 5 passages per question.

### 5.1 Main Results

We present the main results on three datasets in
Table[4](#S5.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"),[5](#S5.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"), and[6](#S5.T6 "Table 6 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") respectively (full results in §[G.6](#A7.SS6 "G.6 Main Results ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")). We first note that all models achieve good fluency scores (except some models on ELI5 mainly due to their longer generations).
We summarize the main takeaways from the experiments below.

#### Vanilla achieves strong performance.

Despite its simplicity, Vanilla (putting retrieved passages in context)
achieves close-to-the-best performance among all prompting strategies.

#### Using summaries or snippets improves correctness.

We see a universal trend that Summ or Snippet improves correctness,
though
on ASQA and ELI5, such an improvement comes at a cost of citation quality
due to the lossy compression. Combining Interact with Summ/Snippet does not bring improvement,
and we hypothesize that
checking the full passages offers limited benefit and
current LLMs are not proficient in an interactive usage.

#### Retrieving text on the fly does not improve performance.

All datasets show that Vanilla outperforms InlineSearch on citation quality (and on correctness for ASQA and ELI5).
By manually examining the examples,
we find that
it is challenging to ask detailed questions without seeing any passages.
To improve InlineSearch,
one may need to provide more context about the questions in advance or
encourage the model to call retrievers with more detailed and diverse queries.

#### Rerank boosts citation quality.

We observe that Rerank leads to consistent improvement in citation quality (on ASQA and ELI5).
As the automatic scores may be biased in Rerank,
we also conduct human evaluation (§[6](#S6 "6 Human Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"))
and verify its effectiveness.

#### ClosedBook+PostCite delivers strong correctness but poor citation quality.

ClosedBook outperforms Vanilla in correctness on ELI5 and QAMPARI, and has only a 2% gap on ASQA.
However, ClosedBook cannot provide any citation;
when combined with PostCite,
the citation quality remains inadequate. For instance,
citation recall of ClosedBook+PostCite is lower than Vanilla by 47% on ASQA.

To understand why ClosedBook achieves better correctness and why PostCite cannot deliver satisfying citation quality,
we manually examine model outputs and find that:
(1) open-book models are easily distracted by irrelevant passages and generate responses with lower correctness,
a phenomenon also observed by*Shi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib42 ""))*;
(2) ClosedBook often generates texts that are correct but not similar to any retrieved passages,
making it difficult to match a citation post-hoc.

#### GPT-4 brings limited improvement but is better at using long context.

We evaluate GPT-4 with Vanilla and different numbers of passages (more results in §[G.6](#A7.SS6 "G.6 Main Results ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).
GPT-4 brings consistent (but limited) improvement on correctness, but often at a cost of citation quality.
GPT-4 can also incorporate more passages due to its longer context window,
which boosts both correctness and citation quality.
On the contrary,
including more passages with ChatGPT-16K does not improve the results (Table [7](#S5.T7 "Table 7 ‣ 5.3 Retrieval Analysis ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")),
suggesting that processing more passages is non-trivial and GPT-4 is better at synthesizing information from its long context than ChatGPT.

### 5.2 Comparison of Different LLMs

|  | Fluency | Correct. | Citation | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (MAUVE) | (EM) | Rec. | Prec. |
| ChatGPT (Vanilla) | | | | |
| DPR (5-psg) | 61.8 | 36.1 | 65.0 | 65.6 |
| GTR (1-psg) | 69.5 | 38.4 | 56.0 | 64.0 |
| GTR (3-psg) | 66.6 | 39.6 | 72.8 | 73.9 |
| GTR (5-psg) | 66.6 | 40.4 | 73.6 | 72.5 |

*Figure 4:  Retrieval recall@$k$ on ASQA (EM recall), QAMPARI (recall-5), and ELI5 (claim recall).
Retrieval recall serves as an upper bound for model performance,
and we compare them with two models’ correctness results in the figure (dashed lines):
“Vanilla (5-psg)” is ChatGPT Vanilla with top-5 passages in context;
“Oracle” is the same model except that it uses 5 gold passages (§[G.1](#A7.SS1 "G.1 Retrieval Analysis ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")), whose recall matches Recall@100 on all three datasets.*

Table[7](#S5.T7 "Table 7 ‣ 5.3 Retrieval Analysis ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") compares
different LLMs on ASQA using Vanilla (more results in §[G.6](#A7.SS6 "G.6 Main Results ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).
Notably, instruction-tuned models (Vicuna-13B and LLaMA-2-Chat)
outperform the original LLaMA models in correctness and
considerably enhance the citation quality.
We observe that
while the original LLaMA models are able to copy facts from the context,
they struggle with accurately citing the sources or simply do not cite.
Notably, the best open-source model, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat, achieves comparable correctness score as the OpenAI models, but still lags behind in citation quality.

### 5.3 Retrieval Analysis

|  | Fluency | Correct. | Citation | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (MAUVE) | (EM Rec.) | Rec. | Prec. |
| Open-source (max #tokens\=2K-4K) | | | | |

| ChatGPT (5-psg) | 66.6 | 40.4 | 73.6 | 72.5 |
| ChatGPT-16K (max #tokens\=16K) | | | | |
| ChatGPT (5-psg) | 60.3 | 36.1 | 76.2 | 76.5 |
| ChatGPT (10-psg) | 56.3 | 36.7 | 75.3 | 75.0 |
| ChatGPT (20-psg) | 56.7 | 36.1 | 73.7 | 73.5 |

| GPT-4 (5-psg) | 67.1 | 41.3 | 68.5 | 75.6 |
| GPT-4 (10-psg) | 71.5 | 43.1 | 72.0 | 75.5 |
| GPT-4 (20-psg) | 64.9 | 44.4 | 73.0 | 76.5 |

*Table 7:  Comparison of different LLMs on ASQA (GTR+Vanilla). LLaMA-13B and Vicuna-13B have a context limit of 2,048 tokens, and thus can only use a short version of instructions and at most top-3 passages.
Chat-13B and Chat-70B refer to LLaMA-2-Chat.*

The retrieval results play a crucial role to the correctness and the citation quality.
Figure[4](#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Comparison of Different LLMs ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") presents
the retrieval recall@$k$ with different datasets and retrievers.
As the number of passages increases, retrieval recall steadily improves.
Additionally, Figure[4](#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Comparison of Different LLMs ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") shows
the correctness performance of two models:
(1) ChatGPT Vanilla with top-5 passages (our primary baseline);
(2) an oracle version of the same model employing
5 gold passages (§[G.1](#A7.SS1 "G.1 Retrieval Analysis ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"); the 5 gold passages match the retrieval recall@100).
Notably,
both models’ correctness lags behind the corresponding retrieval recall (except for ELI5 top-5).
The discrepancy suggests that
despite the presence of accurate answers in context,
LLMs struggle to utilize them in their outputs.

We compare the impact of different retrievers and different numbers of passages to LLMs.
Figure[4](#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Comparison of Different LLMs ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") (right)
shows that
GTR outperforms DPR in both correctness and citation quality,
emphasizing the importance of deploying better retrievers.
Contrary to the retrieval recall trend in Figure[4](#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Comparison of Different LLMs ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"),
more passages in context do not yield substantial improvement for ChatGPT.
Specifically, correctness plateaus at top-1 passage and citation quality plateaus at top-3.
GPT-4 (Table[7](#S5.T7 "Table 7 ‣ 5.3 Retrieval Analysis ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")) exhibits an increasing trend with more passages,
but the improvement is not proportional to the retrieval performance.
This indicates the limited ability of LLMs in utilizing multiple passages within context.

### 5.4 Other Ablations

We provide additional ablations in §[G](#A7 "Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").
In summary, we find that
(1)
using comprehensive instructions
enhances the citation quality of instruction-tuned models (§[G.2](#A7.SS2 "G.2 Effect of Instructions ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"));
(2)
including at least one demonstration improves the performance (§[G.3](#A7.SS3 "G.3 Effect of Demonstrations ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"));
(3) fine-tuned models (FiD; *Izacard and Grave, [2021](#bib.bib13 "")*) with PostCite lag behind LLMs in both correctness and citation quality and fail to generalize (§[G.4](#A7.SS4 "G.4 Fine-tuned Models ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).

6 Human Evaluation
------------------

To verify that our automatic evaluation correlates with human judgement,
we conduct human evaluation on selected models and request workers
to judge model generations on three dimensions similar to *Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24 ""))*—(1) utility: a 1-to-5 score indicating whether the generation helps answer the question; (2) citation recall: the annotator is given a sentence and all passages that the sentence cited, and is asked to judge whether the passages fully support the sentence; (3) citation precision: given a sentence and one of its citations, the annotator is asked to judge whether the citation “fully supports”, “partially supports”, or “does not support” the sentence.
Each citation gets a precision score 1 if the output sentence has a citation recall of 1 and this citation at least “partially supports” it.
See Appendix[F](#A6 "Appendix F Human Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") for more details.

|  | Human scores | | ALCE scores | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Rec. | Prec. | Rec. | Prec. |
| ChatGPT Vanilla | 74.7 | 76.6 | 75.3 | 74.4 |
| w/ Rerank | 79.3 | 81.9 | 83.9 | 80.8 |
| Vicuna-13B Vanilla | 51.6 | 51.5 | 50.3 | 50.1 |

*Table 8:  Human citation quality evaluation vs. ALCE citation quality evaluation on ASQA.*

|  | Human scores | | ALCE scores | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Rec. | Prec. | Rec. | Prec. |
| ChatGPT Vanilla | 50.8 | 52.4 | 52.8 | 50.4 |
| w/ Rerank | 59.7 | 60.6 | 63.0 | 60.6 |
| Vicuna-13B Vanilla | 13.4 | 19.2 | 13.6 | 18.1 |

*Table 9:  Human citation quality evaluation vs. ALCE citation quality evaluation on ELI5.*

#### Model outputs score high utility.

The utility scores do not differ significantly between models, ranging $3.7$-$3.9$ for ASQA and $3.5$-$3.6$ for ELI5.
Upon inspection, all tested models are mostly able to output fluent answers that are related to the question, despite differences in factual correctness.

#### Our automatic evaluation of citation quality strongly correlates with human judgements.

As shown in Table[8](#S6.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 6 Human Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") (ASQA) and Table[9](#S6.T9 "Table 9 ‣ 6 Human Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") (ELI5),
the relative rankings induced by human and our automatic metrics are consistent.
The absolute citation scores from human and ALCE are very close except for Rerank (which uses the automated citation recall for reranking).
This suggests that an improvement on ALCE citation metrics translates to improvement on human preferences. Furthermore, the Cohen’s kappa coefficient between
human and ALCE suggests substantial agreement for citation recall ($0.698$) and moderate agreement for citation precision ($0.525$).
We also show in §[G.5](#A7.SS5 "G.5 More Human Evaluation ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") that our automatic evaluation achieves high accuracy when treating human annotations as gold labels
($85.1\%$ for citation recall and $77.6\%$ for citation precision).

7 Related Work
--------------

#### Evaluating citations.

Generating text with citations is closely related to attribution. *Rashkin et al. ([2023](#bib.bib38 ""))* define the “attributable to identified sources” (AIS) score to measure how faithful a generated text is to its sources. *Bohnet et al. ([2022](#bib.bib1 ""))* apply AIS scores on a single-document short-answer QA dataset. *Honovich et al. ([2022](#bib.bib12 "")); Yue et al. ([2023](#bib.bib52 ""))* study automatic evaluations for the AIS score.
A concurrent work*(Liu et al., [2023](#bib.bib24 ""))* conduct human evaluation on commercial generative search engines to
examine their citation qualities.

Scientific citation text generation*(Funkquist et al., [2022](#bib.bib7 ""))* is a related task to ALCE where the model is provided the papers-to-cite and context and is required to recover the citing text.
It is different from ALCE
as all citations are provided
and the model only needs to perform the summarization.

#### Retrieval-augmented LMs.

Many studies have explored augmenting LMs with
externally retrieved information. *Guu et al. ([2020](#bib.bib9 "")); Borgeaud et al. ([2022](#bib.bib2 "")); Izacard et al. ([2022](#bib.bib14 ""))* pre-train language models with retrieved passages,
while *Khandelwal et al. ([2020](#bib.bib19 "")); Zhong et al. ([2022](#bib.bib55 ""))* augment
LLMs’ output by interpolating it with a $k$NN module;
though none of them explicitly provide citations to the retrieved sources.
Other works prompt or fine-tune LLMs to
“retrieve on-the-fly” *(Parisi et al., [2022](#bib.bib31 ""); Schick et al., [2023](#bib.bib40 ""); Shuster et al., [2022](#bib.bib43 ""); Jiang et al., [2023](#bib.bib16 ""); Yao et al., [2023](#bib.bib51 ""); Press et al., [2022](#bib.bib35 ""))*,
which offers flexibility of when and what to search. *Gao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib8 "")); He et al. ([2022](#bib.bib10 ""))* propose to first generate text without accessing external documents and then
retrieve relevant documents and revise the generation to be consistent.

Among previous explorations, *Nakano et al. ([2021](#bib.bib27 "")); Menick et al. ([2022](#bib.bib25 ""))* are the closest to our setting, where
LLMs are trained to answer questions while providing citations.
However, they do not explore retrieval strategies and simply use commercial search engines, which are not reproducible, and their models and training data are closed-source.
To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to implement end-to-end systems that retrieve, synthesize, and cite documents with LLMs.

8 Conclusion
------------

We propose ALCE, the first automatic benchmark for evaluating LLM generations with citations.
We deploy automatic metrics to measure fluency, correctness, and citation quality, and verify their efficacy via human evaluation.
We explore a variety of strategies for incorporating citations in LLMs
and demonstrate that current systems have considerable room for improvement on ALCE.

Our experiments highlight a number of promising research directions, including
(1) enhancing retrieval and refining retrieval integrations in LLMs,
(2) developing long-context LLMs, and
(3) advancing LLMs’ ability to synthesize multiple sources.
What’s even more intriguing is that these research proposals extend beyond the ALCE setup (for example, long-context LLMs have numerous exciting applications), and
ALCE can serve as a valuable testbed for their development.

Limitations
-----------

Our evaluation still has room for improvement:
(1) MAUVE is found to be sensitive to output length and may provide unstable results;
(2) for the ELI5’s correctness evaluation, the automatically generated claims may not cover all possible answers due to the open-ended nature of the questions;
(3) our citation quality evaluation is limited by the accuracy of the NLI model; for citation precision, the NLI model cannot detect the case of “partially support” and thus
leads to a lower citation precision score than the human evaluation.

Although we believe our curated datasets closely resemble the distribution of real-world user questions,
we acknowledge that they do not cover more challenging scenarios, such as
multi-hop reasoning, math reasoning, and code completion.

In our experiments, we focus on prompting LLMs without updating their model weights.
Training a model directly to incorporate citations remains challenging due to the lack of supervised data.
However, we observe that certain human-instruction datasets
contain examples similar to our task setup.
We leave the exploration of training LLMs to generate citations for future work.

Appendix A Generating Claims for ELI5
-------------------------------------

We elect not to use ROUGE-L as our main correctness metrics since it does not account for the different ways of expressing the same answer and it can be easily gamed *Krishna et al. ([2021](#bib.bib21 ""))*.
We further illustrate this issue in Table [10](#A1.T10 "Table 10 ‣ Appendix A Generating Claims for ELI5 ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").
A system can easily achieve high ROUGE-L score by retrieving and returning the top passage from a BM25 index.
However, the claims evaluation metric does not reward this approach since the output often lacks different aspects of the answers.

|  | ROUGE-L | Claim recall |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ChatGPT Vanilla | 20.6 | 12.0 |
| ChatGPT Oracle | 21.2 | 21.3 |
| LLaMa-13B Vanilla | 16.2 | 3.9 |
| Top-1 passage | 19.1 | 3.0 |

*Table 10:  Comparison between ROUGE-L and claim recall scores on ELI5.*

Instead, we leverage the original answers
to generate sub-claims
and use them to serve as an estimate of the different aspects of the answers that we expect the model to cover.
This approach is inspired by works in summarization evaluation and claim verification *Zhang and Bansal ([2021](#bib.bib53 "")); Kamoi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib17 "")); Wang et al. ([2020](#bib.bib49 ""))*.

Specifically, we use text-davinci-003 to generate the sub-claims.
We first manually annotate three question and answer pairs from the original ELI5 training set with 3 sub-claims each.
Then, we prompt text-davinci-003 with these pairs as demonstrations.
The full prompt with an example is shown in Table [22](#A7.T22 "Table 22 ‣ G.7 Open-source Models ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").

#### InstructGPT generates coherent and faithful sub-claims.

To ensure that the generated sub-claims are of good quality, we manually inspect a random sample of 40 answers and their generated sub-claims (totaling to 120 sub-claims).
For each sub-claim, we assign a score of $1$ if it is relevant to the question and faithful to the facts presented in the ground truth, and <!-- MathML: <math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="A1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.2.m2.1"><semantics id="A1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.2.m2.1a"><mn id="A1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="A1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">0</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.2.m2.1b"><cn id="A1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" type="integer" xref="A1.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.2.m2.1.1">0</cn></annotation-xml></semantics></math> -->00 otherwise.
We found that $112$ out of the $120$ ($93.33\%$) sub-claims received a score of $1$, meaning that our generated sub-claims are of high quality and faithful to the ground truth.
Furthermore, the average number of words in the generated sub-claims is $14$ words, and they are typically just one sentence long.
This is aligned with the intent behind the metric—to capture short factual claims made by the original answer.

#### NLI model accurately predicts the entailment of sub-claims.

We further analyze our sub-claim evaluation metrics by checking the error rate of the final prediction of the NLI model.
To this end, we first manually annotate the entailment scores between 40 outputs and their sub-claims (in total of 120 pairs; these are the same questions from the previous analysis).
We then use the NLI model to obtain the entailment scores for the output and sub-claims.
Using the human annotations as the ground truth label, we found that the NLI model achieved an accuracy of $80.0\%$.

Appendix B Dataset Statistics
-----------------------------

For ASQA, human answers have an average length of 65 words.
For QAMPARI, each question has on average 13 answers.
For ELI5, human answers have an average length of 131 words.

Appendix C Implementation Details
---------------------------------

#### NLI model.

We use the version of TRUE model from <https://huggingface.co/google/t5_xxl_true_nli_mixture>, which is trained on
SNLI*(Bowman et al., [2015](#bib.bib3 ""))*,
MNLI*(Williams et al., [2018](#bib.bib50 ""))*,
Fever*(Thorne et al., [2018](#bib.bib46 ""))*,
Scitail*(Khot et al., [2018](#bib.bib20 ""))*,
PAWS*(Zhang et al., [2019](#bib.bib54 ""))*,
and VitaminC*(Schuster et al., [2021](#bib.bib41 ""))*.
This model uses the following prompt: “premise: {PREMISE} hypothesis: {}”
and outputs “1” if the premise entails the hypothesis.
We format each passage (when used as premise)
by the format of “Title: {TITLE}\n{TEXT}” and concatenate all passages with “\n” as a separator.

#### MAUVE.

When running MAUVE, we concatenate the question and the model output (or human answer) by space.
We truncate both the references and the model generations to 100 words,
as we found MAUVE results are unstable beyond this length for ELI5 (this is due to that ELI5 has a lot of extremely long human answers).

#### Exact match for ASQA and QAMPARI.

Both ASQA and QAMPARI provide aliases for their short answers.
We normalize the response and the short answers similarly to *Rajpurkar et al. ([2016](#bib.bib37 ""))* and report the score with the best-matching aliases.
For ASQA, *Stelmakh et al. ([2022](#bib.bib44 ""))* also propose a QA-based evaluation which we found to be not as stable, and thus we do not report it in our paper.

#### Output truncation.

Before evaluation,
we truncate model output by new lines,
as non-instruction-tuned models may generate more content after new lines that are irrelevant.

#### Interact.

Empirically, we found that models tend to execute too many consecutive “check” actions, so we force the model to always “output” after each “check”.
We limit the maximum number of passages to check as 3 to avoid exceeding the length limit.
The full passages are removed from the context after one action to save context space.
Table[27](#A8.T27 "Table 27 ‣ Appendix H Prompts ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") provides an example for Interact.

#### Main experiments.

For all experiments except ChatGPT Rerank,
we run each model three times with different seeds and each time we sample two demonstrations from a pool of four.
We report the averaged scores for all experiments in the main paper
and we report the standard deviations in Appendix [G.6](#A7.SS6 "G.6 Main Results ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").

#### Decoding methods.

Based on preliminary experiments we choose the following decoding methods: For ChatGPT and GPT-4, we use sampling with temperature $0.5$; for all open-source models, we use Nucleus sampling*(Holtzman et al., [2020](#bib.bib11 ""))* and set $\text{top\_p}\=0.95$.

Appendix D ALCE Catches Shortcut Cases
--------------------------------------

|  | Fluency | Correct. | Citation | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (MAUVE) | (EM Rec.) | Rec. | Prec. |
| ChatGPT | 66.6 | 40.4 | 73.6 | 63.0 |
| Top-1 passage | 20.8 | 35.1 | 99.4 | 99.4 |
| First 2 sents | 67.2 | 18.9 | 98.7 | 98.7 |

*Table 11:  ASQA cheating cases. “ChatGPT”: the ChatGPT Vanilla model with GTR-retrieved top-5 passages.
“Top-1 passage”: use the top-1 retrieved passage as the response.
“First 2 sents”: use the first 2 sentences of the top-1 retrieved passage.*

Table[11](#A4.T11 "Table 11 ‣ Appendix D ALCE Catches Shortcut Cases ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") demonstrates the experiments to show that ALCE
is robust to shortcut cases.
Using the top-1 passages or first two sentences of the top-1 passages
induces almost perfect citation quality,
but fluency and correctness are dramatically lower.

Appendix E Citation Recall Discussion
-------------------------------------

Our citation precision evaluation cannot detect a citation that partially supports the statement and hence will falsely penalize it.
Consider a statement $s_{3}$ and its citations [2][4][5]:
if [2] entails partial information of $s_{3}$ that [4][5] also entails, [2] will be counted as “irrelevant” while it should not be penalized. *Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24 ""))* conduct human evaluation on citation precision in a different way:
For each citation,
they ask annotators to judge whether the citation (1) fully support, (2) partially support, or (3) does not support $s_{i}$.
One citation $c_{i,j}$ is precise if
(a) $c_{i,j}$ fully supports $s_{i}$ or
(b) $\mathcal{C}_{i}$ fully supports $s_{i}$, $c_{i,j}$ partially supports $s_{i}$, and no $c\in\mathcal{C}_{i}$ alone fully supports $s_{i}$.
This evaluation solved the corner case we mentioned in the main paper (one citation partially supports the claim but is identified as “irrelevant”).
However, it is challenging to conduct such evaluation automatically,
as there is no existing model that can judge whether a citation “partially” supports a claim.
We also explore prompting ChatGPT to conduct such a task, which yields poor results.
We defer it to future work to collect supervised data to train a better $\phi$ that can detect “partial support”.

We employ Surge AI (<https://www.surgehq.ai/>) for our human evaluation.
The average pay to workers is 20 USD per hour.
We randomly sample 100 examples from ASQA and ELI5 and annotate outputs of selected models: ChatGPT Vanilla, ChatGPT Rerank, and Vicuna-13B Vanilla.

### F.1 Utility

To check if the model output is useful to downstream users, we measure the utility of the response $\mathcal{S}$.
We first show the query $q$ and model response $\mathcal{S}$ to the worker and ask them to rate their agreement with
the statement "The response is a helpful and informative answer to the query" on a Likert scale of 1-5,
corresponding to Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, and Strongly Agree.

### F.2 Citation Recall

The annotators are shown the question $q$, the statement $s_{i}$, and all of its citations $\mathcal{C}_{i}$, and they rate if the joint set of citations fully support the statement (recall\=1) or if they do not support all the claims (recall\=0).
We calculate the overall recall score
for the generation by taking an average of all the statements’ recall scores.

### F.3 Citation Precision

We show the question $q$ and a pair of a statement $s_{i}$ and one of its citation $c_{i,j}\in\mathcal{C}_{i}$
to the annotator.
We ask the annotator if the citation fully supports, partially supports, or does not support the factual claims in $s_{i}$.
Citation $c_{i,j}$ has a citation precision of $1$ if $s_{i}$ has a recall of $1$, and
$c_{i,j}$ fully or partially supports $s_{i}$.
Finally, we take an average of precision scores of all citations in the statement $\mathcal{S}$ to obtain the citation precision score.

### G.1 Retrieval Analysis

#### Oracle.

Since the original datasets do not contain gold passages
at the same granularity level as our setting (100-word passages),
we approximate gold passages by running the following algorithm on the top-100 retrieved passages.
We first calculate the recall score for each passage. Then, we sort the passages using their recall score and take the top 5 passages as our initial oracle set.
Finally, we iterate through all passages that were not initially in the oracle set and try to replace the passages in the oracle set in a greedy fashion: we calculate the change in the recall score of the oracle set for every possible replacement and proceed with the replacement that results in the largest recall improvement. The set of 5 oracle passages were able to match the recall scores of the top-100 retrieved passages.

#### Detailed retrieval results.

We show detailed retrieval results in Tables[12](#A6.T12 "Table 12 ‣ F.3 Citation Precision ‣ Appendix F Human Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"), [13](#A6.T13 "Table 13 ‣ F.3 Citation Precision ‣ Appendix F Human Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"), and [14](#A6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ F.3 Citation Precision ‣ Appendix F Human Evaluation ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").

### G.2 Effect of Instructions

Table[15](#A7.T15 "Table 15 ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") shows results of using a full instruction (Table[23](#A8.T23 "Table 23 ‣ Appendix H Prompts ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")) and a short version of the instruction (Table[24](#A8.T24 "Table 24 ‣ Appendix H Prompts ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations")).
We see that the full version induces stronger correctness and citation recall, while the two instructions lead to similar citation precision.

### G.3 Effect of Demonstrations

Table[16](#A7.T16 "Table 16 ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") shows results on effect of different numbers of demonstrations.
We see that
numbers of demonstrations do not affect ChatGPT’s correctness but
using at least one demonstration
ensures high citation recall.
For the original LLaMA model, Table[16](#A7.T16 "Table 16 ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") shows the trend that more demonstrations lead to better performance.

### G.4 Fine-tuned Models

To better understand the differences between fine-tuned models and prompted large language models, we train state-of-the-art question answering model, Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD; *Izacard and Grave ([2021](#bib.bib13 ""))*), and evaluate it in conjunction with PostCite.
Due to the lack of training data with citation annotation, we first train a T5-base FiD model for 5 epochs on the ASQA training set with a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 1e-4.
During evaluation, we use PostCite to add citations to the output.
We also use $k\=5$ passages during both training and evaluation of the FiD model.

Then, we evaluate this model on both ASQA (in-domain) and ELI5 (out-of-domain), and the results can be found in Tables [17](#A7.T17 "Table 17 ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations") and [18](#A7.T18 "Table 18 ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").
Note that this is not a direct comparison, as ALCE assumes only evaluation data available and uses only few-shot data for prompting.
As the results show, the FiD baseline still significantly lags behind prompting ChatGPT in both correctness and citation quality (even though it is trained on 4000+ examples).
When tested on another dataset (ELI5), FiD performs even worse, showing that it is challenging to solve the problem by fine-tuning a small pre-trained model.

### G.5 More Human Evaluation

We evaluate the accuracy of our automatic metrics by treating the human annotations as gold labels.
For citation recall, ALCE achieves an accuracy of $85.1\%$; for citation precision, ALCE has an accuracy of $77.6\%$.
Regarding detecting insufficient citations, ALCE has a recall of $82.3\%$ and a precision of $84.2\%$;
regarding detecting “irrelevant” citations, ALCE has a recall of $75.6\%$ and a precision of $66.1\%$—ALCE is effective in detecting “irrelevant” citations, but
due to the limitation of the NLI model (cannot detect “partial support”), it has a relatively high false positive rate.

### G.6 Main Results

We show full results of our experiments along with the standard deviation
in Tables [19](#A7.T19 "Table 19 ‣ G.7 Open-source Models ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"), [20](#A7.T20 "Table 20 ‣ G.7 Open-source Models ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"), and [21](#A7.T21 "Table 21 ‣ G.7 Open-source Models ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").
We repeat all experiments with three different random seeds.
However, for ChatGPT Rerank, we use only one seeded run since each run repeats the generation step four times, and more experiments would incur significant costs. Similarly, due to the cost of running ChatGPT-16K and GPT-4, we only use one seeded run for each model.

### G.7 Open-source Models

In addition to the open-source models discussed in the main text, we also show the results of LLaMA-7B, Alpaca-7B, Vicuna-7B, LLaMA-33B, Oasst-33B, and Stable Beluga 2 in the Tables [19](#A7.T19 "Table 19 ‣ G.7 Open-source Models ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"), [20](#A7.T20 "Table 20 ‣ G.7 Open-source Models ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations"), and [21](#A7.T21 "Table 21 ‣ G.7 Open-source Models ‣ Appendix G More Experiments ‣ ALCE: An Automatic Benchmark for Large Language Model Generations with Citations").
For selected models, we also tested them using approaches beyond Vanilla.

Although open-source models generally lag behind the state-of-the-art models (i.e. GPT-4) in both correctness and citation quality, the largest instruction-following models (i.e. LLaMA-2-70B-Chat and Stable Beluga 2) can sometimes achieve competitive correctness to the SoTA.

Furthermore, we found that the open-source models follow a similar trend between different approaches as ChatGPT. Specifically, using Summ and Snippet improves correctness and Rerank boosts citation quality.

|  |
| Original question: What’s the difference between Shia vs. Sunni Islam? |
| Passage: The main difference between Shia and Sunni Muslim is related to ideological heritage and issues of leadership. This difference is first formed after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 A.D. The ideological practice of the Sunni branch strictly follows Prophet Muhammad and his teachings, while the Shia branch follows Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law Ali. Nowadays, Sunni and Shia are the major branches of Islam. |
| Claim 1: The major branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia. |
| Claim 2: Prophet Muhammad died in 632 A.D. |
| Claim 3: The ideological practice of the Sunni branch strictly follows Prophet Muhammad and his teachings. |

| Original question: What causes Bi-polar disorder? |
| Passage: Bipolar disorder is an emotional disorder that causes extreme mood swings between excitement and depression. The spectrum of mood swing may span from days to months. We are still not certain of the exact factors that cause such disorder, but genetics is considered a major factor. |
| Claim 1: One symptom of Bi-polar disorder is extreme mood swings between excitement and depression. |
| Claim 2: Genetics could be one of the major factors that causes Bi-polar disorder. |
| Claim 3: The mood swing from Bi-polar disorder can last days to months. |
|  |
| Original question: How do we hear differences in sound besides volume and pitch? |
| Passage: Pitch refers to the frequency of soundwave, and volumn refers to the amplitude of the soundwave. Besides volumn and pitch, we can also tell the difference between sounds based on the tone of sound. For example, we can differentiate the sound of different instruments based on the tone of the sounds. |
| Claim 1: Volume of sound is the amplitude of the soundwave. |
| Claim 2: Pitch is the frequency of soundwave. |
| Claim 3: We can use the tone of the sounds to differentiate the sound of different instruments. |
|  |
| Original question: How are we able to discern whether a sound is coming from in front of us or behind us? |
| Passage: There are multiple explanations for why we can localize sounds. One explanation is that sounds travelling to the corresponding side of one’s ear will be slightly louder. Another explanation is that there is a slight difference in the hitting time to one’s left and right ear based on the sound’s direction. However, these explanation means that when a sound is exactly in front of someone or exactly behind someone, he or she can not tell the difference. |
| Claim 1:  We can localize sounds by recognizing that the sound travelling to the corresponding side of one’s ear will be slightly louder. |
| Claim 2: We can also localize sounds by recognizing the difference in hitting time to one’s left and right ear based on the sound’s direction. |
| Claim 3: We cannot tell the difference between a sound that is exactly in front of us or exactly behind us. |

You know how your mom always warned you not to eat raw cookie dough? This is why. Most people do eat cookie dough and they are fine, but salmonella is a risk. If you do contract salmonella, you could start to feel bad within in a couple of hours after eating contaminated food, and sometimes it could take a day or two. Common symptoms are nausea and vomiting, loose stools (sometimes bloody), flu like symptoms, and stomach cramps. To treat |

The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning on Tuesday that strongly advises against continuing the habit. The agency asserted that consuming raw batter of any kind, whether for bread, cookies or pizza, could make a person sick. While you may have been warned in the past against eating raw dough due to the risk of contracting salmonella from raw eggs, the FDA is citing raw flour as the culprit for a |
| Document [3](Title: It’s Probably OK to Eat Raw Cookie Dough — As Long As You’re Smart About It - The Crux - Very Top Secret Information) First, when most people think about health risks and cookie dough, they think about raw egg. Eggs can be contaminated with salmonella bacteria, and food safety recommendations encourage people to cook eggs until the white and yolk are firm in order to kill any bacteria. However, anyone making cookies can do things to reduce this risk by using pasteurized egg products. When my kids and I make cookie dough, we never use regular eggs. Instead, we use shell eggs that have been pasteurized to kill any harmful bacteria without actually cooking the egg itself. (A great public health innovation, if |

Scientists reveal the truth about this supposedly dangerous delicacy By Katherine Dempsey There are few things more tempting in life than eyeing a bowl of cookie dough and deciding whether or not to stick your finger in for a scoop. It’s a bit like playing Russian roulette. You could get lucky and enjoy the delicious dough without conseqence, but there’s always the risk of getting serously sick with a food-borne illness. That’s because multiple ingredients within the dough could be contaminated by pathogens such as Salmonella and E. coli, says Soohyoun |

However, other ingredients in the dough could potentially harbor pathogens. Experts say that a prime suspect in a 2009 E. coli outbreak linked to prepackaged cookie dough was actually the flour. Nuts and chocolate have also been linked to Salmonella outbreaks. Bottom line: You’re better off skipping raw cookie dough. At least you’ll have killer cookies as a consolation.

| Question: Why is it bad to eat cookie dough for risk of salmonella but things like Cookie Dough Bites are ok? |
| Answer:  Raw cookie dough is not recommended to be eaten due to the risk of salmonella [1][2]. Eating raw flour is also a risk for food poisoning [2]. The egg in cookie dough is usually pasteurized, so it’s not likely that the egg would make you sick, but other ingredients in the dough could potentially harbor pathogens [4][5]. However, prepackaged cookie dough like Cookie Dough Bites is safe to eat because the dough is made with pasteurized egg products and heat-treated flour [2][3].. |
|  |
| Ground truth claims: |
| 1. Cookie Dough Bites are safe to eat since they do not contain eggs. |
| 2. Salmonella is a bacteria found in eggs. |
| 3. Eating raw cookie dough carries the risk of salmonella infection. |

Every start-up must one day fulfill the market’s demand that it turn a profit, but Uber has never figured out how to do that. While ride sharing in some form will probably survive, it’s more likely that without some drastic changes, Uber won’t be around in three to five years.
