###### Abstract

We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention.
In this work, we show that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples).

1 Introduction
--------------

We study the problem of answering questions, such as “Can a microwave melt Toyota Prius battery?”, given access to a large unstructured corpus like Wikipedia. The de facto approach to solving the problem is to use language models (LMs) coupled with the ability to retrieve relevant documents (e.g., Wiki passages) against queries, i.e., the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm *(Jeong et al., [2024]; Jiang et al., [2023]; Chan et al., [2024]; Asai et al., [2023])*. However, answering complex questions often requires multi-hop reasoning and retrieval, i.e., the LM has to iteratively decompose the user utterance into sub-queries or search phrases (e.g., “melting point of Toyota Prius battery”), retrieve documents relevant to the sub-queries, and reason through the retrieved documents to issue further sub-queries, until the LM is able to generate an answer for the original query.

Most of recent work in this space focus exclusively on the accuracy of generated answers, using (a) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) techniques on large QA training datasets*(Asai et al., [2023]; Chan et al., [2024]; Hsu et al., [2024])*, or (b) reinforcement-learning (RL) based techniques such as GRPO*(Jin et al., [2025])* and DPO*(Hsu et al., [2024])*. In either case, they rely on tens or even hundreds of thousands of training data points, either in the form of <question, answer> demonstrations or as <question, documents> relevance signals. For instance, the most recent work SearchR1*(Jin et al., [2025])* applies GRPO to fine-tune the Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct*(Yang et al., [2024])* model using more than 100000 training examples on the popular HotPotQA*(Yang et al., [2018])* dataset. Similarly, another recent RAG framework called LeReT*(Hsu et al., [2024])* uses more than 90000 training examples on the same dataset, using Llama3.1-8B*(Grattafiori et al., [2024])*. However, in real-world QA settings, ground-truth labelled examples are difficult to obtain and latency of the system is critical for user experience. In this work, we challenge the claims in the recent literature in multiple ways:   
(1) Efficiency, i.e., number of hops or searches needed to accurately answer, is equally important; 
(2) The oft-overlooked simple baseline strategy of ReAct for iterative retrieval and reasoning*(Yao et al., [2023]; Shao et al., [2023])*, with optimized few-shot prompting, already is quite competitive to several recent techniques; the prompt optimization needs tens of examples, in stark contrast to aforementioned RAG techniques like Self-RAG and SearchR1 that need several orders of magnitude more number of examples, and 
(3) We can leverage RL-based techniques like GRPO to further improve such strong baselines, from the perspective of efficiency where they often underperform, using just 1000 training examples.

Our solution, FrugalRAG, is a two-stage framework that removes the need for large-scale labels while still achieving effective and efficient inference-time search. In the first stage, the model is trained to maximize evidence coverage by generating diverse and informative search queries across multiple hops. In the second stage, we post-train the model to decide when to stop retrieving and generate an answer. This decision is modeled explicitly, allowing the model to weigh the cost of further retrievals against the confidence in the retrieved evidence.

Optimizing for coverage and efficiency in a single stage leads to unstable training; we find that models either over-retrieve or stop too early. Our key insight is that learning when to stop is more naturally learned through reinforcement learning (RL) signals, whereas better coverage can be obtained by repeatedly issuing high quality search queries using frameworks such as ReAct. By separating the exploration stage from decision making, FrugalRAG better aligns the learning signal with the multi-hop RAG task resulting in high quality and efficient retrievals.

We evaluate FrugalRAG on standard benchmarks such as HotPotQA*(Yang et al., [2018])*, 2WikiMultiHopQA*(Ho et al., [2020])* and MuSiQue*(Trivedi et al., [2022b])*, using both document retrieval metrics such as recall and answer quality metrics. Compared to baselines, we show that FrugalRAG obtains the highest document recall and answer quality while incurring a low number of search queries per question. In particular, on HotPotQA, FrugalRAG using a 3B model obtains higher document recall with only two searches per question compared to methods such as LeReT and SearchR1 that are based on 8B and 7B models and include finetuning on thousands of examples.

Which metric to optimize. Multi-hop QA involves two sub-tasks: retrieving relevant documents, and then answering the question based on the documents. Some methods report document retrieval-specific metrics such as recall*(Hsu et al., [2024])* whereas others report final answer metrics such as exact match*(Jin et al., [2025])*. Typically, a model is trained to optimize a particular metric (such as recall) and also evaluated on the same metric. For robustness, in this work we train on the recall metric and test on all metrics, including final answer metrics.

Prompting-based RAG approaches. With the recent advancements in the capabilities of large API-based LMs, some works explored prompting to call external search/retrievers at inference. Toolformer*(Schick et al., [2023])* uses a self-supervised objective to train an external model that decides to call tools (like Bing and Google search engines). ReAct*(Yao et al., [2023])* is another powerful prompting technique that allows the model to structure its outputs as thoughts, actions and observations, yielding significant improvements in the ability of LLMs to interact with external environments. *Trivedi et al. ([2022a])* proposed IRCoT, another prompting strategy that alternates between chain-of-thought*(Wei et al., [2022])* steps and gathering evidence through retrievals. By using the intermediate traces, the IRCoT is able to decide what to retrieve by issuing the right search queries. Iter-RetGen*(Shao et al., [2023])* improves evidence gathering in multi-hop scenarios by combining retrieval and generation iteratively, such that a model’s response is incorporated in the reasoning trace. However, both IRCoT*(Trivedi et al., [2022a])* and Iter-RetGen*(Shao et al., [2023])* rely on a fixed or predefined number of retrieval loops at inference, offering limited control over latency.

Finetuning-based techniques. A prevalent method for multi-hop QA using small LMs is supervised finetuning using reasoning traces from a large LM such as GPT-4*(Asai et al., [2023]; Chan et al., [2024])*. Other methods are trained to predict the next query to be retrieved*(Chan et al., [2024])*. Methods that scale the test-time compute that infer using multiple trajectories have also been proposed*(Wang et al., [2025])*. Recently, reinforcement learning-based techniques have been proposed that develop a reward based on outputting the ground-truth answer*(Jin et al., [2025])*.
However, none of the techniques focus on efficiency of the solution. In fact, in Search-R1, the goal of RL is to increase the number of searches. Instead, we use RL to decrease the average number of searches done by our model.

1. 1.

    Traditional RAG approaches. Early work in grounding generation with real world documents focused on end-to-end differentiable encoder-decoder pipeline REALM*(Guu et al., [2020])*, which augments Masked-Language Modeling (MLM) with a latent retriever model, backpropagating through retrieval to learn both retriever and generator jointly. However, this approach incurs significant computational cost and has only been shown to work with relatively smaller models like T5*(Raffel et al., [2020])*. Building on this,*Lewis et al. ([2020])* proposed a general finetuning strategy, RAG-Token which demonstrated that join-training outperforms fixed dense retrieval and BM25.

2. 2.

    RL-based Retrieval Augmented Generation. Recently, framing search query as an RL problem has received attention. LeReT*(Hsu et al., [2024])* performs preference optimization using diverse few shot prompts leveraging hundred-thousands of ground truth annotated documents. However, LeReT utilizes a fixed amount of compute per instance during inference and cannot be readily generalized to variable-hop scenarios. Similarly, concurrent works, *Jin et al. ([2025])* and*Chen et al. ([2025])* propose end-to-end RL-based optimization that only leverages the final answer annotation. These methods show that RL can effectively be used to teach the search query generator model to issue more search queries for multi-hop problems without considering latency. Our two-stage RL framework, by contrast, first explores without RL to maximize recall and then learns to stop at test time using RL.

3 FrugalRAG: Two-stage training framework
------------------------------------------

We describe FrugalRAG, a novel framework for enhancing retrieval augmented generation in LMs by decoupling the evidence exploration stage from answer generation. FrugalRAG demonstrates several key advantages over contemporary RAG approaches – (1) Requires only 1000 annotated training examples which is a 100 times reduction in dataset size compared to existing works*(Jin et al., [2025]; Hsu et al., [2024]; Chan et al., [2024])*, (2) Dynamically adapts test-time compute which results in low inference time latency and high retrieval recall, unlike existing fixed compute methods*(Hsu et al., [2024])*.

Setup. Let $Q$ denote a complex user question that requires multiple iterative retrievals to answer. Let $f$ denote a language model (LM) that, at each reasoning hop, examines the current context and determines the next action. At hop $h$ (where $1\leq h\leq B$, and $B$ is the maximum allowed number of hops), the model $f$ produces a thought–action-search query triplet $(T_{h},A_{h},S_{h})$. The search query $S_{h}$ is passed to a retriever $\mathcal{R}(\cdot)$, which returns a set of documents: $\mathcal{D}_{h}\=\mathcal{R}(S_{h})$ from the document index, say $\mathcal{I}$.

Let $\mathcal{D}_{0}$ denote the initial context—either empty or initialized as $\mathcal{R}(Q)$. At hop $h$, the model has access to the context:

|  | $\left{Q\right}\cup\bigcup_{0}^{h-1}\left{(\mathcal{D}_{h},T_{h},A_{h},S_{h})\right}$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- |

This includes the original query, all previously retrieved documents, and the previously generated thought, action, search query triplets.

The process continues until the model outputs a special finish action, terminating after $h_{\text{term}}$ hops (or at the budget limit $B$). At this point, a separate generator LM $g$ is invoked to produce the final answer, conditioned on the original question $Q$ and the full context accumulated up to termination.

The central challenge for $f$ is to iteratively construct highly targeted queries $S_{h}$ such that the retriever $\mathcal{R}$ can surface a minimal yet sufficient set of documents to answer $Q$ within the hop budget $B$.

FrugalRAG requires access only to ground truth documents $Y$ during training. It does not require supervision in the form of final answer annotations. These documents are used to provide fine-grained feedback signals. At inference time, FrugalRAG relies solely on the input question $Q$, the document index $\mathcal{I}$, and a trained retriever $\mathcal{R}$.

Our key observation is that, with sufficient test-time compute, even base models can generate multiple, diverse search queries to address a question—following the ReAct paradigm (e.g., see Sec[4], TableLABEL:tab:hotpot-7b). Therefore, the goal of our work is not to scale up test-time computation, as argued in prior work*(Jin et al., [2025]; Chen et al., [2025])*, but rather to adaptively control it based on the difficulty of each question.

In the following subsections, we describe the two stages of our learning algorithm:

* •

    Stage 1 (Sec.[3.1] ‣ 3 FrugalRAG: Two-stage training framework ‣ FrugalRAG: Learning to retrieve and reason for multi-hop QA")): Generating a base policy that maximizes evidence coverage through exploration

* •

    Stage 2 (Sec.[3.2]): Finetuning this policy with reinforcement learning to control test-time compute

### 3.1 Stage 1: Evidence Coverage Maximization (Explore)

Gathering evidence plays a crucial role in answering multi-hop questions, which often require iterative retrieval and reasoning across multiple sources. Drawing on recent advances in test-time scaling, we observe that we can boost evidence coverage (i.e., recall) simply by letting the model $f$ issue multiple search queries $S_{h}$ at inference time. This approach sidesteps the need for massive supervised fine-tuning—instead, it harnesses the model’s own generated rollouts to gather, and then integrate additional information. In the next section, we describe how we construct our training data and design our fine-tuning protocol to fully leverage this capability.

Training Dataset Generation. We choose ReAct*(Yao et al., [2023])* for generating rollouts. Here, a rollout is a set of outputs generated by the model $f$. In the standard ReAct setup, an off-the-shelf model $f$ generates a thought-action pair $(T_{h}A_{h})$ at each hop $h\in[1,B]$, where $A_{h}$ is either a call to the retriever $\mathcal{R}$ or finish indicating the end of rollout. At each hop $h$, we generate samples ${(T_{h}^{1},A_{h}^{1},S_{h}^{1})\dots(T_{h}^{n},A_{h}^{n},S_{h}^{n})}$ using $n$ bootstrapped prompts*(Khattab et al., [2023])* (See Appendix[A]). For each search query $S_{h}^{i},i\in[1,n]$ we retrieve corresponding documents $\mathcal{D}_{h}^{i}\=\mathcal{R}(S_{h}^{i})$, then discard any documents already present in the context. We then compute recall against ground-truth labels and add the sample $i$ that achieves the highest recall to the context for the next hop $h+1$. This dataset generation strategy is simple and easily parallelizable. We conduct two separate runs – the standard ReAct framework where $f$ is allowed to generate finish, and the second where $f$ can only call the retriever. Although the former is more efficient and finishes before B search hops, we observe that the latter yields a significantly higher overall recall owing to a greater number of retrievals. Unlike previous work*(Chan et al., [2024]; Asai et al., [2023]; Hsu et al., [2024]; Jin et al., [2025])* that generated orders of magnitude more data, we only generate 1000 examples during this step.

Supervised “Exploration” Finetuning (FrugalRAG-Explore). Although the base model $f$ without finish maximizes exploration, we cannot use it directly for reinforcement learning because it does not include finish. Consequently, during fine-tuning, we sample rollouts from both configuration described above, 90% without finish and 10% with it. We want to use supervised finetuning to build a strong base-policy for RL, that prioritizes exploration while ensuring that finish remains in the model’s generation distribution. Hence, we finetune the model $f$ to obtain our base policy $f_{S}$. At each iteration, the model predicts the next $(T_{h},A_{h},S_{h})$ tuple given the rollout which comprises interleaved thought-action-search tuples and retrieved documents represented as an ordered set ${(\mathcal{D}_{0},T_{0},A_{0},S_{0}),(\mathcal{D}_{1},T_{1},A_{1},S_{1})\dots(\mathcal{D}_{(h-1)},T_{(h-1)},A_{(h-1)},S_{h-1})}$ till $h-1$, using standard cross-entropy error as the objective function. $f_{S}$ has several notable advantages – (1) off-the-shelf model $f$ does not explore. Despite prompt optimization, $f$ is generally over-confident and predicts the answer without sufficient exploration. (2) removing finish results in over-retrievals. We observe that simply removing finish from the ReAct loop yields high recall even with the base model $f$, however, the model is forced to utilize the full budget for every question and cannot be post-trained for efficiency as it never generates a rollout with finish.

### 3.2 Stage 2: Controlling test-time compute with RL

Given a finetuned base policy model $f_{S}$, we propose a strategy that enables the model to generate extended rollouts only when required. This mechanism is crucial for inference-time efficiency, as it allows the model to adaptively determine the appropriate rollout length. Since $f_{S}$ generally prioritizes exploration, our only goal is to learn when to sufficient evidence has been gathered, thereby reducing overall search latency during inference. Below we show how this problem can be formulated as a reinforcement learning task, as it requires evaluating and comparing different rollouts. However, unlike recent work using RL for scaling the number of retrievals*(Jin et al., [2025])*, here our focus is to use RL to reduce the number of retrievals per question.

Reward Design. Our reward function is designed to guide the model toward discovering the optimal rollout length. To compute the reward, we first generate the complete rollout using the policy $f_{S}$ and then evaluate it. Let $h^{*}$ denote the optimal number of retrieval steps (or hops), defined as the point beyond which further retrievals do not improve the overall recall $c$. If the model terminates at a hop $h_{\text{term}}>h^{*}$, it incurs a penalty for redundant steps. Conversely, stopping at $h_{\text{term}}<h^{*}$ is also penalized to encourage sufficient exploration. This reward structure enables the model to explore adequately for complex queries while avoiding unnecessary computation for simpler ones. The reward is defined as:

|  | $\displaystyle\mathbf{R}\=\begin{cases}\displaystyle\max\left(-R_{\max},\min\left(\log\left(\frac{1-\Delta}{\Delta}\right),R_{\max}\right)\right),\&\text{if }\Delta>0\land c\geq\tau\quad\text{(late stop)}\\ \displaystyle R_{\max}+\alpha\cdot\left(\frac{h^{*}}{B}\right),\&\text{if }\Delta\=0\land c\geq\tau\quad\text{(perfect stop)}\\ \displaystyle\max\left(-R_{\max},\min\left(\log\left(\frac{1-\Delta}{\Delta}\right),0\right)\right),\&\text{if }c<\tau\quad\text{(early stop)}\end{cases}$ |  | (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Here, $\Delta$ is the normalized difference $(h_{\text{term}}-h^{)}/B$, where $B$ is the maximum hop budget. $R_{\max}$ is the upper bound on the reward, and $\alpha$ is a tunable hyperparameter that scales the bonus for stopping exactly at $h^{*}$. This bonus is proportional to $h^{*}/B$, thereby assigning higher reward to correct terminations on more complex (i.e., longer) rollouts. A rollout is considered answerable if its recall $c$ is greater than or equal to a predefined threshold $\tau$.

Intuitively, the reward function penalizes deviations from the optimal stopping point in proportion to $|\Delta|$. The closer the model stops to $h^{*}$, the higher the reward, with the maximum attained when $h_{\text{term}}\=h^{*}$.

In addition to $\mathbf{R}$, we define a format reward $\mathbf{R_{f}}$ to enforce adherence to the ReAct-style format. If the output deviates from the expected format and results in failed retrievals, we assign a reward of $-1$; conversely, if the retrievals succeed, the model receives a reward of $+1$. This reward is averaged across all hops. The final reward is the mean of the main reward $\mathbf{R}$ and the format reward $\mathbf{R_{f}}$, yielding an overall reward in the range $[-R_{\max}-1,\ R_{\max}+\alpha+1]$.

Optimal Rollout Length. We define the optimal rollout length $h^{*}$ as the minimum number of retrieval steps required to answer a query $Q$ effectively. Any additional retrievals beyond $h^{*}$ are considered redundant. Conversely, if the rollout has not yet gathered sufficient evidence to answer the query, it should continue retrieving. To balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we use FrugalRAG-Explore as a reference policy, assuming it represents the best achievable performance within a fixed budget $B$. If another policy achieves the same recall performance as FrugalRAG-Explore in fewer than $B$ hops, we set $h^{*}$ to that lower number of hops and compute the reward using Eq[1].

Optimization. Motivated by the recent success and memory efficiency of GRPO*(Shao et al., [2024])*, we adopt it as our optimization algorithm. At each hop $h$, we sample $v$ tuples ${T_{h}^{i},A_{h}^{i},S_{h}^{i}}_{i\=1}^{v}$, and retrieve their corresponding documents $\mathcal{D}_{h}^{i}$, and deduplicate. We repeat this until we reach the maximum budget $h\=B$, collecting sample tuples and documents. For each rollout $i$, we then compute a cumulative reward using Eq.[1], and backpropagate through every logit produce by the policy along that rollout. Finally, once $f_{S}$ emits the finish token, we mask any further generations. The detailed steps are provided in Algorithm[1].

4 Experiments
-------------

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

Benchmarks. We conduct evaluation of FrugalRAG using three widely adopted Multi-Hop RAG benchmarks– HotPotQA*(Yang et al., [2018])*, 2WikiMultiHopQA*(Ho et al., [2020])* (2Wiki), and MuSiQue*(Trivedi et al., [2022b])*, under their full-wiki setting using a ColBERT-v2*(Santhanam et al., [2021])* retriever index over Wikipedia passages provided in official datasets. These datasets require models to perform reasoning across multiple documents to arrive at an answer. The HotPotQA benchmark comprises of of 7405 development examples requiring supporting evidence from Wikipedia abstracts. We report the results on the entire dev-set to access the models ability to perform end-to-end reasoning and retrieval. For the 2WikiMultiHopQA benchmark, we utilize 12576 development examples, each coupled with its supporting evidence and document title. This evaluates a model’s ability to hop between structured and unstructured wikipedia text. Finally, for MuSiQue, we test on its 2405 development examples of 2-4 hop questions derived from a composition of two-hop queries. We provide details of the datasets and the index in Appendix[C].

Metrics. Most prior work focuses on the final answer accuracy*(Jin et al., [2025])* or document-level recall*(Hsu et al., [2024])*. In this work, we evaluate FrugalRAG on three key parameters, namely, goodness of final answer, retrieval recall, and efficiency. To assess the final answer fidelity we report F1 Score, EM (Exact Match), and Match Score. F1 score is the word level harmonic mean of precision and recall between predicted and ground truth string. EM requires the predicted string to exactly match the ground truth. Match requires the ground truth to be a substring of the generated answer. We also evaluate the alignment of supporting evidence with the retrieved documents by reporting Recall and Support-F1 *(Trivedi et al., [2022b])*. Finally, we compute the Latency of FrugalRAG as the total number of search operations it performs to answer a given query. In Sec[4], we introduce metric to realize the tradeoff between efficiency and performance (answer/retrieval), computed as the average performance per search. A detailed overview of metrics is presented in the Appendix[B].

Baselines. We evaluate FrugalRAG by comparing it against no-retrieval and retrieval-based baselines. The no-retrieval baselines include naive generation and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting*(Wei et al., [2022])*. The retrieval-based baselines are vanilla retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with CoT, ReAct*(Yao et al., [2023])*, and optimized few-shot prompting with ReAct*(Khattab et al., [2023])*. We also compare FrugalRAG to recently proposed approaches that leverage large-scale fine-tuning, including Search-R1*(Jin et al., [2025])*, LeReT*(Hsu et al., [2024])*, and CoRAG*(Wang et al., [2025])*. However, we note that these recent methods do not report all metrics that we consider and their metrics may not be directly comparable (due to varying model sizes and retrievers). Therefore, we conduct comparisons using the closest model scales and overlapping subsets of evaluation metrics.

Training. FrugalRAG is model agnostic – we train Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct using our two-stage framework. In both the supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning (RL) stages, we leverage the TRL library*(von Werra et al., [2020])*, and our ReAct pipeline with prompt bootstrapping is built on DsPy*(Khattab et al., [2023])*. For each dataset, we prepare the Stage 1 finetuning dataset with 1000 randomly sampled examples from the corresponding training split. Stage 1 (Sec.[3.1] ‣ 3 FrugalRAG: Two-stage training framework ‣ FrugalRAG: Learning to retrieve and reason for multi-hop QA")) consists of full-parameter finetuning for a single epoch, using a learning rate of $2\times 10^{-5}$ and a weight decay of 0.01 for all models and datasets. We choose a maximum sequence length of 4096 during finetuning. In Stage 2 (Sec.[3.2]), we further train the finetuned models via GRPO*(Shao et al., [2024])*. For a detailed list of hyperparameters refer Appendix[A].

In Tables[1] and Table[2], we compare FrugalRAG against strong baselines on HotPotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue. For fair comparison, all baselines use the ColBERTv2*(Santhanam et al., [2021])* retriever indexed on Wikipedia (See Appendix[A]. The key takeaway is that FrugalRAG consistently outperforms the baselines on both answer and retrieval metrics, using competitive or significantly smaller number of searches on average.

The ReAct Few Shot (FS) baseline *(Yao et al., [2023]; Khattab et al., [2023])* outperforms vanilla Retrieval Augmented Generation and ReAct without few shot prompts consistently. The optimized prompts enable ReAct FS to generate more search queries, and as a result achieve very strong performance. Strikingly, on HotPotQA, ReAct FS achieves (a) 77.44% and 77.65% recall with Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct respectively, which is greater than the recall achieved by LeReT*(Hsu et al., [2024])* (77.1% using Llama3.1-8B) after significant finetuning; and (b) comparable Exact Match (42.1) to that of the recently proposed methods such as Search-R1*(Jin et al., [2025])* (43.3 using base, 37.0 using instruct); signifying the importance of building a strong baseline.

Table[1] and Table[2] demonstrate the overall effectiveness of FrugalRAG-Explore achieving the highest Recall and Support F1 scores compared to all baselines. However, we note that we note that FrugalRAG-Explore is either best or second best in terms of both answer and recall metrics but introduces a very high latency compared to FrugalRAG. Stage-2 finetuning significantly reduces the number of searches required while retaining the performance across three datasets. We define an efficiency score metric as the average performance per search. For instance, the search count on HotPotQA reduces on average by -53.05% across the three models and the F1 scores improve by +3.5% for a marginal drop in recall. A similar trend is observed in the case of 2Wiki and MuSiQue, where the search count reduces on average by -19.87% and -21.17% and the F1 scores improve by +5.65%, +0.68% respectively.

Compared to recent approaches such as LeReT*Hsu et al. ([2024])*, which evaluate performance on HotPotQA, FrugalRAG achieves higher recall (79.62 vs. 77.10) with only a marginal increase of +0.96 in the average number of retrieval steps. Additionally, despite relying on an off-the-shelf answer generator $g$, FrugalRAG outperforms reasoning-based baselines like Search-R1*Jin et al. ([2025])* on Exact Match in 2 out of 3 datasets. The lower performance on 2Wiki compared to Search-R1 is primarily due to the use of an off-the-shelf answer generator, whereas Search-R1 employs a trained model for answer generation.

Overall, our results highlight that our method strikes a significantly better efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, compared to strong baselines.

### 4.3 Analysis

In this section, we present a discussion on the various properties of FrugalRAG and demonstrate its effectiveness through ablation studies. For our analysis, we choose HotPotQA (2 hops) and MuSiQue (upto 4 hops) datasets due to the managable size of their datasets.

Adaptive vs Fixed Budget Search. A simple way to make ReAct baselines more efficient is to limit their number of searches to a fixed budget. Does variable compute (searches) really help in handling questions of varying difficulty?  To get an estimate of the query difficulty and search requirements, we look at the histogram of number of searches in the trajectories of FrugalRAG-Explore up until when 100% Recall is attained. Fig.[1(a)] illustrates that most additional searches beyond a certain point are redundant (Estimated Optimal Searches), and the utility of each additional query diminishes exponentially, from the perspective of Recall. So, we can expect ReAct baselines with fixed (small) search budget to attain competitive performance.

We investigate the utility of variable compute in Fig[1(b)] with Qwen3.5-3B-Instruct and in Fig[1(c)] with Qwen3.5-7B-Instruct. We consider the best baseline (ReAct FS), and give it a search budget $B$, and ensure that it does not generate finish till the entire budget $B$ is consumed. This allows us to directly compare the accuracy of FrugalRAG that uses variable budget per query with fixed-budget baselines. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, we find that FrugalRAG consistently outperforms ReAct across all budgets $B\={2,3,4,5,6}$ in terms of F1 score, while also being more efficient. On HotPotQA, FrugalRAG achieves an F1 of 55.81 compared to ReAct FS ($B\=6$) at 53.17. Similarly, on MuSiQue, FrugalRAG reaches 18.71, slightly improving over ReAct’s 18.84, but with fewer retrieval steps on average. This trend also holds for the larger Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model. On HotPotQA, FrugalRAG achieves a significantly higher F1 of 63.03, compared to 57.59 from ReAct FS ($B\=6$), while requiring only around 2.5 searches on average. On MuSiQue, FrugalRAG reaches 24.78 (with roughly 4 avg searches) compared to ReAct FS ($B\=6$) at 17.82, again demonstrating superior performance and efficient retrieval (Detailed Tables are provided in the Appendix).

Impact of RL based training. To capture the trade-off between answer quality and retrieval cost, we define two key metrics:

* •

    % Tradeoff (Answer) quantifies how effectively each retrieval contributes to answer quality:

    |  | $\%\text{Tradeoff}_{\text{Answer}}\=100\times\frac{\text{F1}+\text{EM}+\text{Match}}{3\times\text{Searches}}$ |  |
    | --- | --- | --- |

* •

    % Tradeoff (Retrieval) measures how well each retrieval contributes to evidence quality:

    |  | $\%\text{Tradeoff}_{\text{Retrieval}}\=100\times\frac{\text{Recall}+\text{Support F1}}{2\times\text{Searches}}$ |  |
    | --- | --- | --- |

These metrics allow us to jointly evaluate answer accuracy and evidence quality relative to the number of retrieval steps, enabling a comparison of efficiency across models and budgets.

To assess the impact of the RL-finetuning (Stage 2), we conduct an ablation study by comparing FrugalRAG against a simple baseline, called FrugalRAG-SFT. This baseline is trained for 1 epoch on the dataset generated during Stage 1, but with one key modification. Instead of sample 90% rollouts without finish, we sample all traces where the model outputs finish on its own.

In Fig.[2], we demonstrate that FrugalRAG on average across all models is better on both $\text{Tradeoff}_{\text{Retrieval}}$ and $\text{Tradeoff}_{\text{Answer}}$. FrugalRAG outperforms both FrugalRAG-SFT and FrugalRAG-Explore by a significant margin using Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on both the datasets as illustrated in Fig.[2]. We note that the FrugalRAG-SFT performance is comparable to FrugalRAG with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Comparison with CoRAG. We compare FrugalRAG against the recent state-of-the-art test-time scaling approach CoRAG*(Wang et al., [2025])*. CoRAG jointly trains the reasoning and the answer generation models on 100K multi-hop examples. In contrast, FrugalRAG relies on an off-the-shelf answer generator, which limits its ability to match the exact answer formats expected by benchmark evaluation scripts. So, we adopt the following approach for fair comparison.

We replicate CoRAG’s experimental setup using the E5-large retriever111[https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large-v2 "") and KILT*Petroni et al. ([2021])* index. We fine-tune FrugalRAG with Llama3.1-8B-Instruct separately on each dataset only using 1000 examples. For retrieval evaluation, we use the publicly released CoRAG outputs222<https://huggingface.co/datasets/corag/> to report Recall and Support F1 using all the retrieved documents, allowing us to compare the decomposition capabilities of FrugalRAG and CoRAG. Concretely, we use the context document ids upto B\=6 searches (30 documents) and extract the titles and passages to compute the recall and support F1 respectively.

In Table[3], we present retrieval-level metrics of CoRAG and FrugalRAG variants on three datasets. The results clearly demonstrate that FrugalRAG, when using the E5 retriever, significantly outperforms CoRAG (B\=6) in both Recall and Support F1. We present a detailed list of hyperparamters for this run in Appendix[A]. This highlights the robustness and generalization ability of FrugalRAG across different retrievers and index corpora. Notably, the number of retrieval queries is substantially higher on KILT*(Petroni et al., [2021])* compared to Wikipedia, which is expected given KILT’s larger document collection (36 million vs. approximately 5 million for HotPotQA, 20 million for 2Wiki/MuSiQue using ColBERTv2*(Santhanam et al., [2021])*).

5 Conclusions, limitations, and future work
-------------------------------------------

In this work, we argue that efficiency is an equally important metric to study in RAG solutions, besides the traditional RAG metrics such as retrieval performance and accuracy of the generated answers. We demonstrate that simple ReAct baseline that iteratively retrieves (by invoking the search tool) and reasons (to decide what search call to issue next) is quite competitive, especially if we can optimize its few-shot prompt using just tens of training examples. We propose a new two-stage framework FrugalRAG that a) works with 1000 training examples, compared to state-of-the-art RAG techniques that use over 100,000 examples, and b) yet achieves competitive accuracies while also using far fewer search queries at inference time, on popular multi-hop QA datasets.

Even though our method uses a small number of examples for training, it has some limitations in the analysis, and leaves room for future work in the following aspects: (a) in terms of generalization to new domains with no access to training data, (b) in terms of scaling the training data to potentially large number of examples, (c) jointly training the answer generator and decomposer. We hope to explore these avenues in the future.

Appendix A Training Details
---------------------------

Algorithm[1] shows the overall training framework of FrugalRAG. We plan to publicly release our code soon and have attached a copy of the codebase for review in the meantime. Below, we discuss each step along with their implementation details.

Few-Shot Prompt Optimization Details. We leverage DSPy*[Khattab et al., [2023]]* for automatic few-shot prompt generation following LeReT*[Hsu et al., [2024]]*. Specifically, we use 50 training examples ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{init}}$) with the BootstrapFewShotwithRandomSearch method, which uses the LM $f$ to generate few-shot examples, selecting the best performing ones for subsequent prompting. We select 4 best performing few-shot prompts from a total of 15 candidate sets using the sum of answer EM and answer passage match. Answer EM checks for an exact string-match between the generated and actual answer, and passage match checks if the actual answer is present in the retrieved passages. This step is crucial because it facilitates dataset generation using diverse rollouts and ensures the answer format is followed by the model. For this step, we serve our model on one GPU using VLLM*[Kwon et al., [2023]]*. For all experiments involving Qwen2.5, we utilize the 7B-Instruct variant for prompt optimization. The optimized prompts are then reused without modification for the 3B variant.

Dataset Generation Details. For each few-shot prompt $p_{i}$, the model $f$ generates a tuple $(T_{h}^{i},A_{h}^{i},S_{h}^{i})$ representing a candidate output for the next hop. As described in Sec.[3.1] ‣ 3 FrugalRAG: Two-stage training framework ‣ FrugalRAG: Learning to retrieve and reason for multi-hop QA"), we evaluate all candidate tuples at hop $h$ and select one with the highest recall. This selected candidate is then used as the context for the next hop and the process is repeated till budget $B$ (optionally till the selected candidate action $A_{h}$ indicates finish). We set the budget $B\=6$, where the initial retrieval step is always $\mathcal{R}(Q^{(j)})$ with $Q^{(j)}$ denoting the original user utterance. The generated dataset is denoted by $\mathbf{D}$. For all experiments involving Qwen2.5, we utilize the 7B-Instruct variant along with its prompts to generate the dataset. For further improving results, we can repeat few shot prompt optimization and dataset generation using different base models.

Supervised "Explore" Finetuning Details. We use the standard next token prediction loss given by:

|  | $\max_{f}\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathbf{D}}\log p_{f}(x|y)$ |  | (2) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $y\=(T_{h},A_{h},S_{h})$ and $x\=Q^{(j)}\cup{T_{k},A_{k},S_{k},\mathcal{D}_{k}}_{k\=0}^{h-1}$ sampled from the generated dataset $\mathbf{D}$.

We train the model $f$ for 1 epoch using a batch size of 4 and apply gradient accumulation of 2 steps, resulting in an effective batch size of 8. Optimization is performed using AdamW*[Loshchilov and Hutter, [2017]]* with a learning rate of $2\times 10^{-5}$. We use a linear learning rate scheduler with a warmup phase of 20 steps. The training is performed using 8 H100 80GB GPUs.

Controlling test-time compute with RL. Our RL step employs GRPO for fine-tuning the base policy $f_{S}$. Specifically, following the notation in DeepSeekMath*[Shao et al., [2024]]*, for each question $Q^{(j)}$, we sample a group of outputs ${o_{h}^{1},o_{h}^{2},\dots,o_{h}^{v}}$ at hop $h$, where $v$ is set to 8. We optimize our base policy $f_{S}$ using the standard GRPO objective using the cumulative rollout reward as defined in Eq.[1]. We use a KL divergence penalty with weight $0.1$ since we have a trained base policy, and set the maximum reward $R_{\max}\=2.0$ for stability. Generation is limited to a maximum of 256 completion tokens and the maximum prompt size is 1024. Training is conducted using DeepSpeed-Zero2*[Rasley et al., [2020]]* and 7 H100 GPUs (where 1 is exclusively reserved for sampling). We set the learning rate to $10^{-6}$. Due to the long prompt (which includes retrieved documents from previous hops), we use a total batch size of 48. We train FrugalRAG for 400 steps across datasets and models, and report the performance using the final checkpoint.

Appendix B Metrics
------------------

F1. is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall measured at the word-level, and is given by

|  | $\operatorname{F1}\=2\cdot\frac{\operatorname{TP}_{\text{ans}}}{\operatorname{TP}_{\text{ans}}+0.5*(\operatorname{FP}_{\text{ans}}+\operatorname{FN}_{\text{ans}})}$ |  | (3) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $\operatorname{TP}_{\text{ans}}$ denotes correctly predicted words, $\operatorname{FP}_{\text{ans}}$ represents the extra words, and $\operatorname{FN}_{\text{ans}}$ are the missing words in the generated answer.

Exact Match. is the exact match between the normalized generated answer string and normalized ground truth answer. It is $100\%$ if the two strings match exactly, and <!-- MathML: <math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="A2.p2.m2"><mn>0</mn></math> -->0 otherwise.

Match Score. measures the accuracy of generated answer by checking if the ground truth answer string is present in the generated answer string. It is $100\%$ if the ground truth string is in the generated answer, and <!-- MathML: <math alttext="0" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="A2.p3.m2"><mn>0</mn></math> -->0 otherwise.

Recall. is a retrieval metric, that measures the percentage of ground truth documents retrieved by the model. It is given by the ratio of correctly retrieved document titles $\operatorname{TP_{\text{doc}}}$ and the total number of ground truth document titles $\operatorname{TP_{\text{doc}}}+\operatorname{FN_{\text{doc}}}$. We measure recall following LeReT*Hsu et al. [[2024]]*, using document titles. The document-level recall is given by –

|  | $\text{Recall}\=\frac{\operatorname{TP_{\text{doc}}}}{\operatorname{TP_{\text{doc}}}+\operatorname{FN_{\text{doc}}}}$ |  | (4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Sup. F1. measures the word-level F1 score ([3]) between the ground truth evidence sentences and those retrieved from the documents. Following*Trivedi et al. [[2022b]]*, we compute the average F1 score across the ground truth evidence sentences, comparing them with corresponding retrieved documents. The evidence sentences are are provided in all three datasets. Supporting Document F1 or Sup. F1 is serves as a more reliable metric for retrieval with 2WikiMultiHopQA and MuSiQue since it considers fine-grained evidence rather than just the document titles.

Appendix C Dataset and Retrieval Index
--------------------------------------

We use the pre-processed Wikipedia abstracts index333[https://downloads.cs.stanford.edu/nlp/data/colbert/baleen/wiki.abstracts.2017.tar.gz](https://downloads.cs.stanford.edu/nlp/data/colbert/baleen/wiki.abstracts.2017.tar.gz "") provided by ColBERTv2*[Santhanam et al., [2021]]* for all our experiments on HotPotQA*[Yang et al., [2018]]*. For each instance, we retrieve the top 3 documents and their titles and perform a maximum 6 retrievals. HotPotQA annotations consists of document title and evidence sentences which are used to compute the Recall and Supporting Document F1 respectively.

Since 2WikiMultiHopQA*[Ho et al., [2020]]* and MuSiQue*[Trivedi et al., [2022b]]* datasets are created using both the body and abstract of wikipedia articles we use the pre-processed dump of Wikipedia provided by*Karpukhin et al. [[2020]]* and index it using ColBERTv2*[Santhanam et al., [2021]]*. The generated index consists of 21M passages. For each instance, we retrieve top 5 documents and append it to our context. For experiments in Table[3], we use E5-Large provided by CoRAG*Wang et al. [[2025]]* indexed on KILT*Petroni et al. [[2021]]* which consists of 36 million passages, and retrieve top 5 documents for all datasets.
