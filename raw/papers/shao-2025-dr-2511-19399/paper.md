Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.

# 1 Introduction

Deep research (DR) models aim to produce in-depth, well-attributed answers to complex research tasks by planning, searching, and synthesizing information from diverse sources (OpenAI, 2025). Existing open DR models are either training-free, using manually designed prompts with off-the-shelf models (Li et al., 2025b,a), or trained indirectly via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) on search-intensive, short-form question answering as a proxy for deep research tasks (Jin et al., 2025; Nguyen et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). Directly training for deep research is challenging because it is hard to evaluate responses: the desiderata for a good response are often underspecified (Xu et al., 2023; Krishna et al., 2021), so a finite set of static rubrics cannot capture all the dimensions along which a response could be good or bad. Moreover, given the knowledge-intensive nature of DR tasks, reliable evaluation requires access to a vast, dynamic corpus of world knowledge, rather than relying solely on the model's parametric knowledge (Gunjal et al., 2025).

In this paper, we introduce Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research tasks. To address the challenge of verification in long-form tasks, DR Tulu is first finetuned on high-quality, naturally occurring user data, and then trained via a new method we call Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training. As Figure 2 illustrates, at each training step, we sample several responses and search traces from the model and generate new rubrics that capture and contrast the good and bad points of these responses. This allows us to dynamically incorporate newly explored information into the rubrics and to ensure that they provide on-policy feedback that can discriminate among model responses.

DR Tulu-8B outperforms the strongest open 8-32B models, including previous state-of-the-art Tongyi Deep Research 30B (Team et al., 2025), by 2.8-40.3 percentage points on four long-form DR benchmarks—AstaBench-ScholarQA-CS2 (Asai et al., 2024; Bragg et al., 2025), DeepResearchBench (Du et al., 2025), ResearchQA (Yifei et al., 2025), and HealthBench (Arora et al., 2025). In addition, it matches or exceeds proprietary systems (e.g.,

OpenAI Deep Research, Perplexity Deep Research, and Gemini3 Pro + Search). As shown in Figure 1, DR Tulu-8B is substantially more cost-efficient than all other models; on ScholarQA-CS2, OpenAI Deep Research costs about USD 1.8 per query, whereas DR Tulu is almost 3 orders of magnitude cheaper at USD 0.0019. To assess performance on an out-of-domain, challenging real-world expert DR task, we additionally construct GeneticDiseasesQA, a clinical dataset that requires models to search for and synthesize supporting evidence to assess the therapeutic eligibility of disease-causing genetic variants. On GeneticDiseasesQA, DR Tulu-8B similarly exceeds or competes with proprietary DR models; no other open models can tackle this task because they are unable to provide citations to supporting evidence.

Our analysis shows that RLER improves the model's ability to produce more comprehensive and in-depth long-form responses with accurate citations, yielding gains of 4.4-14.5 points on top of the finetuned model across the four benchmarks. Moreover, DR Tulu learns to select appropriate search tools and arguments depending on the task, instead of relying on a single hard-coded search tool like in prior work (Gao et al., 2025; Bragg et al., 2025). For instance, on ResearchQA, DR Tulu uses paper search  $90\%$  of the time, whereas on DeepResearchBench, whose questions span more diverse, general-domain topics, it relies on web search and browsing about  $55\%$  of the time.

We fully release our data, code, and models to support future work on long-form deep research. In particular, we provide a deep research library with MCP search tools (dr-agent-1ib), together with an evaluation suite, that integrates diverse search and browsing tools and allows new tools to be specified and swapped in with minimal effort. Our training and inference stack supports asynchronous tool calling, making it practical to train and evaluate models on deep research trajectories with many tool calls. We hope these resources will serve as a simple, extensible foundation for future open deep research agents.

# 2 Problem Formulation for Deep Research

We consider a deep research model to be a language model (LM) equipped with search tools. Each tool takes a query and arguments, returning textual resources that can be cited in the model's answer.

Formally, let  $\mathcal{T} = \{T_1,T_2,\ldots \}$  denote the available tools. Each tool  $T_{k}$  takes a query  $q$  with optional argument string  $\alpha$  and returns an observation  $o = T_{k}(q;\alpha)$ . The model's policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  (with parameters  $\theta$ ) operates autoregressively over a sequence of text  $s$ , initialized as  $s_0 = x$  (the task and system instructions). Concretely, we define the model's action space as  $\{\text{think}, \text{tool}, \text{answer}, \text{cite}\}$ , with corresponding protocol tokens:

- think (<think></think>) uses the LM itself to plan next steps given the current state and information.  
- tool (<call_tool></call_tool>) invokes one of multiple search-related tools. The specific tool is chosen by setting the name attribute and tool-specific arguments. Example: <call_tool name="google_search" k="10" lang="en">query</call_tool>. We append the tool's output, in plain text, to the context for subsequent steps.  
- answer (<answer></answer>) produces the final response and stops.  
- cite (<cite id="SOURCE_ID"></cite>) is used within the answer to wrap claims in citation tags that point to the supporting source. Ideally, these citations should be as localized as possible (e.g., to a snippet within a webpage vs. the entire webpage).

At each step  $i$ , the model samples an action and its content or arguments,  $(a_{i},\zeta_{i})\sim \pi_{\theta}(\cdot \mid s_{i})$ , where  $a_{i}$  specifies the action type:  $a_{i} = \text{think}$  for generating reasoning text;  $a_{i} = \text{tool}$  for calling the corresponding tool  $T_{k}$  with query  $(q_{i},\alpha_{i})$ ;  $a_{i} = \text{answer}$  for producing the final answer; and  $a_{i} = \text{cite}$  for wrapping claims in citations within the final answer. If  $a_{i}\in \{\text{think},\text{answer},\text{cite}\}$ , the output  $\zeta_{i}$  is appended to the context, forming  $s_{i + 1} = s_i\oplus \langle a_i,\zeta_i\rangle$ . If  $a_{i} = \text{tool}$ , the model executes the tool call, receives  $o_{i} = T_{k}(q_{i};\alpha_{i})$ , and updates the state as  $s_{i + 1} = s_i\oplus \langle a_i,\zeta_i,o_i\rangle$ . The process continues until  $a_{\tau} = \text{answer}$ , where  $\zeta_{\tau}$  contains the final answer.

Figure 3 Training with RLER. Given a training instance, the policy LM  $\pi_{\theta_t}$  generates multiple rollouts via interacting with the environment. We then invoke another LM to create new rubrics based on those rollouts and the current rubrics in the rubric buffer. We score each generation against those rubrics and use that score to update model weights. We then add the new rubrics to the rubric buffer and filter it to retain only a fixed number of rubrics with the highest variance among rollouts.

# 3 RLER: Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics

We introduce Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), our method for training long-form deep research models using rubrics that are specific to instances, grounded on external knowledge, and evolving with the policy model. This section introduces the preliminaries of RL with rubrics (§3.1), details our rubric generation and management approach (§3.2), and presents analyses demonstrating its effectiveness (§3.3).

# 3.1 Preliminaries: RL With Rubric Rewards

Given a question  $x$  and its set of corresponding rubrics  $\mathcal{R}_x = \{(r_{x,k}, w_{x,k})\}_{k=1}^K$ , where each  $r_{x,k}$  is a rubric (item) and  $w_{x,k}$  is its corresponding weight, we assess the quality of the response  $y$  with the rubric-based scoring function

$$
S (x, y) = \frac {\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} w _ {x , k} \cdot \mathrm {J U D G E} \left(r _ {x , k} , y\right)}{\sum_ {k : w _ {x , k} > 0} w _ {x , k}}, \tag {1}
$$

where, for each rubric  $r_{x,k}$ , we use a separate judge LM that returns 0, 0.5, or 1 depending on the extent to which  $r_{x,k}$  is satisfied by the final answer in  $y$ . We compute this rubric score using only the final answer, i.e., regardless of the reasoning and search traces. Note that rubrics are instance-specific, i.e., each question has its own set of rubrics. Rubric weights can be negative to penalize undesirable aspects.

During training, our goal is to optimize the expected reward over questions in the training set. In practice, we optimize this objective using the GRPO (Shao et al., 2024b) algorithm; we discuss further details in §4.2.

Existing work instantiates the rubric set  $\mathcal{R}_x$  in two main ways. The first approach is to use general rubrics, where an LM is prompted to score the response using a single general rubric shared across all instances (Liu et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024, 2025a). However, several works have shown that this approach suffers from reward hacking, where the model exploits biases in the judge rather than learning meaningful behaviors (Gunjal et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2024). The second approach is to use an LM to generate question-specific rubrics, and then a (potentially separate) LM to perform checklist-style evaluations based on those rubrics (Gunjal et al., 2025; Viswanathan et al., 2025). We refer to these rubrics as closed-book rubrics since they are generated by a closed-book LM; these are therefore constrained by the generating model's parametric knowledge and might not cover the necessary knowledge to assess DR outputs. In both cases, the rubrics are static: they do not adapt as the policy explores new evidence or behaviors.

# 3.2 Evolving Rubrics

Designing rubrics for long-form deep research tasks is particularly challenging. First, long-form questions are often under-specified and admit many plausible ways a response could be good or bad, so a small set of fixed criteria cannot capture all relevant dimensions of quality. Second, DR tasks are highly knowledge-intensive: reliable evaluation requires checking claims against a broad, evolving corpus of world knowledge, rather than relying solely on an LM's parametric knowledge. As a result, closed-book rubrics generated directly by an LM can miss critical evidence, fail to distinguish subtle errors, and are vulnerable to reward hacking by models that exploit judge biases.

We address these challenges by constructing rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model and are grounded on searched knowledge from the internet. Specifically, instead of trying to exhaustively enumerate all possible desiderata, our method generates rubrics tailored to the current policy model's behaviors, offering on-policy feedback the model can effectively learn from. Furthermore, the rubrics are generated with retrieval, ensuring it can cover the needed knowledge to assess the generation. A detailed illustration on the core RLER training process is in Figure 3.

We next describe the components of our evolving-rubric framework: first, how we initialize rubrics, then how we adapt them online during training, manage the rubric buffer, and finally incorporate auxiliary format and citation rewards, following the pseudocode provided in Algorithm 1.

Initial search-based rubrics. For each training prompt  $x$ , we build a customized rubric buffer to store evolving rubrics that are dynamically updated during training. Before training, we initialize the rubric buffer with search-based rubrics. Specifically, for each  $x$ , we first perform  $\mathsf{SEARCH}(x)$  to retrieve relevant context from the internet using the original question. We then concatenate the retrieved documents with the question  $x$  and feed them into an LM,  $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{rubric}}$ , to produce a set of initial rubrics that will be persistently used throughout RL training:  $\mathcal{R}_x^{\mathrm{persist}} = \{R_1, R_2, \dots, R_{K_s}\}$ , where  $K_{s}$  denotes the number of persistent rubrics.

Evolving rubrics during training. During training, we add a new set of evolving rubrics to the active rubric buffer,  $\mathcal{R}_x^{\mathrm{active}}$ , which are used for scoring. In each training step, for every prompt  $x$  and its corresponding set of responses  $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^G$ , where  $G$  denotes the number of rollouts, we concatenate the prompt  $x$ , all sampled responses  $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^G$  (including the search context and final answers), and the existing rubric pool  $\mathcal{R}_x = \mathcal{R}_x^{\mathrm{persist}} \cup \mathcal{R}_x^{\mathrm{active}}$  as input to  $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{rubric}}$ , obtaining a set of evolving rubrics  $\mathcal{R}_x^{\mathrm{new}} = \mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{rubric}}(x, \{y_i\}_{i=1}^G, \mathcal{R}_x)$ . Specifically, we instruct the LM to generate two types of evolving rubrics: (1) positive rubrics, which capture strengths or new, relevant knowledge explored by the current policy but not yet reflected in  $\mathcal{R}_x$ , and (2) negative rubrics, which summarize common undesirable behaviors, such as reward hacking observed across responses. For example, copying retrieved results verbatim to maximize citation precision, or writing an overly long paragraph to gain rubric points and then appending many irrelevant statements with citations to separately boost citation rewards. In both cases, negative rubrics can capture and suppress such behaviors in time. The detailed prompt for evolving rubric generation is provided in Appendix A.1.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Rubric Type</td><td colspan="2">Uses Search</td><td colspan="2">Assertive Claims</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Frac.</td><td colspan="2">Factuality</td></tr><tr><td>General Rubrics</td><td>×</td><td>0</td><td colspan="2">/</td></tr><tr><td>Closed-book Rubrics</td><td>×</td><td>0.22</td><td colspan="2">0.94</td></tr><tr><td>Initial Rubrics</td><td>✓</td><td>0.56</td><td colspan="2">0.97</td></tr><tr><td>Evolving Rubrics</td><td>✓</td><td>0.52</td><td colspan="2">1.00</td></tr></table>

Table 1 The fraction of assertive and factual rubrics. Both the initial search-based rubrics as well as the evolving rubrics (which continue to use search, as they are generated based on the full rollouts including search traces) have a higher proportion of assertive claims compared to closed-book or general rubrics.

Figure 4 Effect of negative evolving rubrics. Over training, negative evolving rubrics emerge that penalize undesirable behavior such as responding in Python (right), resulting in a reduction in undesirable behaviors over the course of training compared to using a static closed-book rubric that does not specify such undesirable behavior (left).

![](images/2511.19399/68dcaa4f4ee6bbd36ff1ddf8d995762f86a63a204b52d7666cd587dcee5df694.jpg)

Rubric buffer management. Without appropriate management of rubrics, the number of rubrics would grow linearly during training as new evolving rubrics are continuously generated. To maintain a compact yet informative set, we developed a rubric buffer management strategy that filters, merges, and ranks rubrics based on their discriminative power. After every GRPO rollout, we score all responses  $\{y_{i}\}_{i = 1}^{G}$  using the current active rubrics and obtain rubric-level scores. Rubrics with zero variance in their corresponding rewards are removed as they offer no discriminative value. We then compute the standard deviation for each remaining rubric and rank them by the standard deviation in descending order. To limit evaluation cost, we retain only the top  $K_{\mathrm{max}}$  rubrics with the highest standard deviation values.

Format, search, and citation rewards. In addition to evolving rubrics, we introduce three auxiliary rewards—format rewards, search, and citation rewards—to explicitly encourage the model to follow the correct formatting instructions, make use of searches, and provide high-quality citations that support all relevant claims. We detail these two auxiliary rewards in Appendix A.3. We combine the auxiliary rewards with the rubric rewards to form the final training reward, assigning small weights to the auxiliary components.

# 3.3 How Do Evolving Rubrics Work?

In this section, we show that our initial search-based and evolving rubrics demonstrate desirable properties, such as being specific and adaptive, enabling the verification criteria to more closely approximate the performance of an ideal rubric set compared to naive rubric generation methods.

Search-based and evolving rubrics make verification criteria more concrete and factual. Table 1 compares the specificity of four rubric types. We define a rubric as assertive if it is specific and concrete about what the response should contain (e.g., "The response should mention benchmarks A and B"), and descriptive otherwise (e.g., "The response should discuss benchmarks"). Descriptive rubrics are easier to generate since they do not require factual knowledge, but they often fail to assess response quality accurately, as a model may score well by superficially mentioning a point or even hallucinating facts. We measure the fraction of assertive rubrics and factuality using an LM, with experimental details provided in Appendix B. As shown in Table 1, general rubrics lack specific evaluation criteria, and instance-wise rubrics generated by a closed-book LM are relatively vague (only  $22\%$  are assertive). In contrast, initial search-based rubrics and evolving search-based rubrics are more concrete, with over  $50\%$  of claims being assertive. These advantages come from search-based rubrics being grounded in retrieved information, and from evolving rubrics being generated using search context, which makes them better suited for training.

Evolving rubrics adjust the evaluation criteria as the policy model evolves. Static rubrics can fail to capture unexpected behaviors or insights emerging during training. As an illustration, we conducted RL training on a single question, "Write a survey paper about RAG." (details in Appendix B). Unexpectedly, some rollouts contained Python code (e.g., Figure 15 in Appendix B), an artifact of the Qwen model that was also previously

reported by Shao et al. (2025); this is undesirable but hard for an initial rubric to anticipate. In contrast, evolving rubrics identify these issues and provide negative feedback about irrelevant code, leading to fewer code-containing responses during training (Figure 4).

# 4 DR Tulu: Training Open Deep Research Agents with RLER

Building on RLER, we introduce DR Tulu-8B, a fully open-source deep research agent. In §4.1, we describe how we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on teacher-generated trajectories to resolve the cold-start problem and teach the model basic planning, tool use, and citation skills. §4.2 further refines DR Tulu with online GRPO and RLER using asynchronous tool calls to improve its long-form reasoning and search strategies. Finally, §4.3, we detail our dr-agent-1ib infrastructure, which is designed to support diverse tools within complex DR workflows and to robustly support high-throughput tool calling in RL training.

# 4.1 Supervised Fine-Tuning for Cold Start

RLER relies on meaningful exploration over tool-augmented trajectories, but a generic base model does not yet know how to plan, invoke tools, or produce citations in the expected format, leading to low-quality rollouts. To make this feasible, we first conduct SFT on trajectories produced by a strong teacher model acting as a tool-augmented deep research agent, which gives DR Tulu a reasonable initial search and citation strategy before online RL. Existing open deep research training data are often built for short-form, constrained tasks, so we construct new large-scale SFT trajectories for open-ended queries. We leverage diverse open-source user and task prompts, generate trajectories in an end-to-end manner, and apply lightweight rejection sampling to filter them.

Prompt curation. For long-form, naturally occurring information-seeking questions, we derive prompts from publicly available user-assistant interaction data: SearchArena (Miroyan et al., 2025), which contains 24K real-world conversations between users and search-augmented LMs across diverse domains, and Open-Scholar (Asai et al., 2024), which provides 55K scientific research-oriented queries collected from a deep research assistant demo. Because real-world queries vary markedly in quality (Cao et al., 2025), we apply a prompt-filtering stage in which an LM rates each prompt on a 1-5 scale (higher is better). For SFT, we mix in a moderate amount of short-form, verifiable QA so the model learns to adapt its style rather than overfit to a single task: we sample from HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), TaskCraft (Shi et al., 2025), WebWalker-Silver (Wu et al., 2025a), and MegaScience (Fan et al., 2025), and we generate additional challenging synthetic prompts inspired by PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023). Further curation details appear in the Appendix SC.1.

Trajectory generation and rejection sampling. Given each curated prompt, we generate a full trajectory (model "thinking" traces, tool calls, tool outputs, and the final response) in an end-to-end manner. We provide GPT-5 with a detailed system prompt that defines the deep research workflow and exposes a general web search tool, a paper search tool, and a web browsing tool, and ask it to produce the entire trajectory. Because GPT-5 does not expose its native internal reasoning, we instruct it to generate explicit mock thinking tokens before each tool call or answer tokens. We then apply two lightweight rejection-sampling filters to ensure that the trajectories strictly satisfy our requirements: (1) for all prompts, we verify that trajectories follow the expected tool-calling and answer formats; and (2) for short-form prompts, we discard trajectories whose final answer does not match the gold answer, following prior work (Jin et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a). As a result, we curated 16K SFT data points, including both short and long-form tasks. Appendix Table 8 shows statistics of our SFT data.

# 4.2 Online RL with Asynchronous Tool Calls

We then further train DR Tulu (SFT) using RLER to allow it to explore and improve both its tool-use and answer capabilities, aided by the evolving rubrics described above. We use a customized variant of GRPO (Shao et al., 2024b) with RLER, in which we iteratively generate agentic rollouts using real tool calls, and then score the model's final answer against the evolving rubrics. This allows the model to effectively explore different

search strategies in an environment with web-enabled tools and learn how to further improve its final answers through feedback provided by the evolving rubrics.

Prompt curation. We focus exclusively on long-form questions for RL training. Following the same LM-based filtering procedure used in long-form SFT data curation, we collect approximately 5K new prompts from SearchArena (Miroyan et al., 2025) and OpenScholar (Asai et al., 2024). Additionally, we sample 4K prompts from RaR (Gunjal et al., 2025) to enhance further data diversity. We note that, although we attempted to collect prompts from diverse sources, the questions we gathered are often still out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to those in downstream benchmarks.

RL training. We train our models with GRPO (Shao et al., 2024a), building on the Open-Instruct implementation (Lambert et al., 2025). We use the basic GRPO loss, albeit using token-level loss aggregation like DAPO (Yu et al., 2025). We apply two further optimizations: we use sample packing to pack multiple rollouts into single training passes with minimal padding, and use 1-step asynchronous training (Noukhovitch et al., 2024), which means we perform generation and training steps at the same time (training on rollouts from a policy one step behind our current policy), reducing training time. We additionally mask out tool output tokens from the loss, following prior work (Jin et al., 2025). We find using a small KL penalty (0.001) useful for stabilizing training. We provide further hyperparameters in Appendix D.2. After generating rollouts and computing rewards, we perform the rubric buffer management steps described in §3.2 before sending the completed samples and rewards to the trainer. We also turned off the citation reward after 650 training steps, as we found it converged and did not further add to performance, whilst dramatically slowing down RL training (due to the large number of API calls required).

Asynchronous tool calling. When performing tool calls during RL training, we use an asynchronous tool call setup similar to Jiang et al. (2025), wherein tool requests are sent the second a given rollout triggers them, as opposed to waiting for the full batch to finish generating before sending tool calls. Once a tool call is sent, we place that given generation request to sleep, allowing the inference engine to potentially continue to work on generating other responses while waiting for the tool response. This results in the generation and tool calling being overlapped wherever possible. Our tool calls are mediated by dr-agent-1ib, our custom agent infrastructure, which allows us to tightly control the number of concurrent calls made to given APIs and to cache repeated queries to increase efficiency and avoid rate limits.

# 4.3 DR Tulu Agent Infrastructure: dr-agent-lib

Developing deep research (DR) agents introduces infrastructure challenges because the LM must orchestrate diverse search and browsing APIs during generation. DR performance is highly sensitive to the quality of these tools, making it crucial to have an extensible infrastructure that allows researchers to easily customize and integrate different tools and APIs. The tool backend should also be scalable and robust to handle high-volume concurrent tool calls during RL training. Ideally, it should also be easy to use and support fast iteration of prompts and tool setups during the SFT stage.

To address these challenges, we developed an agent library called dr-agent-lib with three key design features. We implement a unified MCP-based tool backend with a collection of local and API-based web search and browsing tools (see full list in Table 11) based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The backend is optimized for high concurrency, including a global cache for repeated tool calls and an asynchronous process lock to manage concurrent requests while respecting rate limits. It also features a lightweight and flexible prompt layer, supporting the composition of different search workflows with fine-grained control over prompts and tool-calling configurations. For training, we implement an auto-search workflow (detailed in Appendix E.1) with the following tools: google_search (query  $\rightarrow$  top web snippets), web_browse (URL  $\rightarrow$  crawled page text), and paper_search (query  $\rightarrow$  top relevant paragraphs from open-access papers).

# 5 Experimental Results

# 5.1 Experimental Settings

**Evaluations.** We evaluated deep research agents on four long-form, open-ended benchmarks spanning general-domain, scientific, and medical applications: HealthBench (Arora et al., 2025), ResearchQA (Yifei et al., 2025), AstaBench-ScholarQA-CS2 (SQAv2; Asai et al. 2024; Bragg et al. 2025), and DeepResearchBench (DRB; Du et al. 2025). HealthBench targets healthcare deep research; SQAv2 and ResearchQA assess synthesis over up-to-date scientific literature; DRB covers general-domain deep research questions; HealthBench consists of questions posed by individual users for healthcare professionals. For all datasets, responses are expected to be in long form and are evaluated using human-written or human-verified rubric items, following the official evaluation protocols. SQAv2 and DRB provide detailed performance breakdowns across diverse aspects of answers, including relevance to the question and instruction-following. For SQAv2, we additionally evaluate fine-grained citation metrics such as precision and recall following official evaluations: citation precision checks whether the cited sources actually support statements with citations, and citation recall checks whether valid citations back all citation-worthy statements. We report both aggregated overall scores and per-aspect scores. We also conduct evaluations of DR Tulu on short-form QA in Analysis.

Baselines. We compare against several categories of deep research systems, mirroring the groupings in Table 2. (1) Open deep research models. We compared against four popular open deep research baselines, including ASearcher-7B (Gao et al., 2025), WebThinker 32B (Li et al., 2025a), Search-R1-7B (Jin et al., 2025), and the concurrent work WebExplorer-8B (Liu et al., 2025) and Tongyi Deep Research-30B (Team et al., 2025). Notably, none of these methods were evaluated on realistic long-form benchmarks, as their training solely focuses on short-form QA tasks. For long-form tasks, we provide the official evaluation prompts to each model and require a full report-style response. (2) Fixed-pipeline deep research. We further evaluated fixed pipeline deep research systems, including WebThinker (report mode) and Ai2 ScholarQA (Singh et al., 2025). Those baselines combine LMs with inference-time only pipelines to generate long-form reports. We ran their official codes with default or recommended configurations. (3) Closed deep research: we evaluated OpenAI Deep Research, Perplexity Sonar (reasoning), Perplexity Deep Research, and Claude-Sonnet Search. We also evaluate the latest Gemini3 Pro + Search (released on November 18), which is reported in its release to achieve superior performance compared to GPT-5 and other proprietary LMs. Note that existing open deep research models do not provide citations by default, and proprietary deep research systems typically only link to URLs. In contrast, DR Tulu supplies snippet-level citations (short supporting passages that directly substantiate each claim). We believe such fine-grained citations make human verification substantially easier and help ensure the correctness of the responses (Liu et al., 2023a). Lastly, as baselines, we also evaluated Qwen3-8B and QwQ-32B with naive RAG inference and separately with our inference pipeline using our dr-agent-lib. We discuss the system prompts and evaluation details in Appendix §E.2.

Training details. We initialize our checkpoint with Qwen3-8B (Yang et al., 2025). For SFT, we run training on one H100 node (8 GPUs) and trained for 5 epochs; the hyperparameters used for SFT are described in Appendix D.1. Overall, finetuning our final SFT model took 136 GPU hours. For RL training, we use the hyperparameters described in Appendix D.2. All training runs were run on 2 H100 nodes (16 GPUs) unless otherwise stated. For rubric and citation scoring, we use GPT-4.1-mini (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14) as an LM judge; we use GPT-4.1 as an rubric generator for both initial and evolving rubrics. For our final training run, we ran for 25 days, using roughly 9700 GPU hours to take 1900 training steps, or 6.8 epochs over our training data. We note that the RL run did not seem to saturate even with this long training time, and we may release future checkpoints with improved performance. We found increasing compute did not improve RL training speed, due to being limited by API rate-limits during rollouts. We show the full RL training curves for our final training run in Appendix F.1. We used Crawl4AI, $^{4}$ , a free open-source tool, for browsing during training time to save costs.

Table 2 Overall results. DR Tulu outperforms all open deep research models, and is competitive with proprietary systems. Rows with a gray background indicate models that use closed models as backbone LMs. Bold indicates the best performance among open models. * denotes scores reported by the original benchmark authors. Except for GPT5 + our tool, we reuse the existing leaderboard results rather than rerunning the evaluations, which would cost a few hundred USD per task; we leave entries as “-” when the original benchmarks do not report the corresponding metric. † denotes that the evaluation was run on a 100-sample subset because the method is expensive. For open models, Ⓞ indicates that the training code is open-sourced, and Ⓛ indicates that the training data is open-sourced. None of the existing open deep research models output citations, so their citation scores on SQAv2 are 0. HealthBench scores can be negative, as HealthBench includes negative rubrics that indicate harmful responses.

Inference details. We use a single inference pipeline equipped with three tools by default: google_search, web_browse, and paper_search for all long-form and short-form tasks, without modifying inference pipelines for each task. Following prior work, we use the Serper Search API<sup>5</sup> for google_search (Li et al., 2025a) and Jina browsing<sup>6</sup> (Gao et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025) for web_browse, instead of the cheaper Crawl4AI browsing that we used for training. We use Semantic Scholar full-text search API<sup>7</sup> for paper_search, which returns paragraphs from relevant papers. We cap the number of tool calls at 10 per rollout to balance efficiency and performance, and we retrieve the top 10 snippets for both google_search and paper_search. For web_browse, whose outputs can be very long, we use Qwen3-8B to summarize the browsed content; we truncate the webpage during training instead of using a reader to improve efficiency.

Rows with a gray background indicate models that use closed models as backbone LMs. Bold indicates the best results among the baselines that do not use propriety models.

DR Tulu-8B outperforms all open deep research models on long-form tasks. Across all four open-ended, long-form evaluation benchmarks, DR Tulu-8B consistently outperforms existing open deep research models by 13.7-53.4 points on average, including much larger 30B-scale models. In particular, open models designed and trained for constrained, short-form tasks, such as Search-R1 or ASearcher, perform poorly on realistic long-form, report-length generation tasks, yielding low overall scores. The WebThinker models, which are larger (32B), still underperform on long-form generation when used with their default inference pipeline. While the concurrent WebExplorer model as well as the previous state-of-the-art Tongyi Deep Research outperform those prior open deep research models, both the SFT and RL versions of DR Tulu-8B outperform both of them. Notably, none of the open baselines produce citations, which results in low overall scores (around 40) on SQAv2, where citation quality is a core evaluation criterion.

DR Tulu-8B outperforms open fixed pipeline deep research heavily engineered for report generation tasks. Open deep research systems with fixed pipelines rely heavily on human-engineered inference workflows to generate long-form reports. In contrast, DR Tulu-8B does not use a separate report-generation pipeline and autonomously decides the length of answers based on given task prompts. WebThinker (report mode) performs competitively on long-form benchmarks, largely due to its pipeline that iteratively drafts and edits answers after running its default search flow with the base model. As shown in Table 4, this dedicated report generation pipeline dramatically increases response length from around 90 tokens/answer to over 4000 tokens/answer on average. However, despite producing substantially longer responses and being  $4 \times$  larger in terms of model size, WebThinker-32B with the customized report mode still lags behind DR Tulu-8B on all tasks. Ai2 ScholarQA, which is specifically designed for scientific literature synthesis and uses Claude Sonnet as the backbone LM, performs competitively with DR Tulu-8B on SQAv2 and surpasses it by 0.7 points on

Table 4 Comparison of model usage statistics on SQAv2. We report answer lengths, tool usage, and citation counts across systems. " - " denotes this information was either not available or it was not applicable. The cost per query is estimated based on model inference on ScholarQA-CS2, following Bragg et al. (2025). More details of cost estimations are available in Appendix F.2.

ResearchQA. However, this fixed pipeline struggles on DeepResearchBench and HealthBench, as it is tailored to literature synthesis rather than general deep research. As such, despite using a much smaller underlying LM and a single inference pipeline, DR Tulu still achieves the best overall average performance. We also found that those fixed deep research systems cannot perform simple short-form QA tasks, as even for simple factoid questions (e.g., those in SimpleQA), they attempt to generate a long-form report, generalizing poorly to these types of queries (see appendix E.2 for an example). In contrast, DR Tulu can effectively answer such short-form questions, which we more comprehensively evaluate in §6.1.

DR Tulu-8B matches or outperforms proprietary deep research systems. DR Tulu-8B outperforms all closed models on SQAv2. Despite performing similarly to DR Tulu on the 4 long-form benchmarks, OpenAI Deep Research generates answers that are roughly three times longer and contain about twice as many citations, as seen in Table 4. DR Tulu additionally outperforms Claude Sonnet Search and Perplexity Sonar (high-reasoning mode) and Perplexity Deep Research. We also find that, interestingly, GPT-5 and Gemini3 Pro with their internal search systems can outperform their respective deep research variants on some datasets. This is likely due to the stronger base LMs used in these setups: the OpenAI Deep Research APIs currently only expose o3/o4-based inference, and the Gemini Deep Research results on the original dataset leaderboard are based on Gemini2.5-era systems. This highlights the importance of underlying model capability in addition to a strong deep research pipeline. Nevertheless, DR Tulu, built on an 8B LM, performs competitively with, and in some cases even outperforms, these latest LM-backed systems.

DR Tulu-8B is significantly cheaper than other proprietary and open deep research systems. Table 4 also highlights the cost advantage of DR Tulu (details of cost estimations are in Appendix F.2). Proprietary deep research systems are significantly more expensive; OpenAI Deep Research costs USD 1.80 per query on SQAv2, and Ai2 ScholarQA (using Claude Sonnet) costs USD 1.30 per query. In comparison, DR Tulu costs approximately USD 0.00008 per query, assuming the user has already paid the hardware and hosting costs (only including the cost of API calls in the query cost). Including the LM inference cost when running DR Tulu via OpenRouter with Qwen3-8B pricing, the total cost is approximately USD 0.0018 per query. This further demonstrates the strong cost-effectiveness of smaller, open-LM deep research models compared to proprietary systems, in addition to non-monetary benefits such as preserving sensitive data locally. Compared to other open deep research models, DR Tulu remains significantly cheaper despite its superior performance: Tongyi DR and Webthinker cost around USD 0.03 and USD 0.003 (for WebThinker in report mode, the cost is USD 0.015 per query) per query, respectively. This is because, beyond using a smaller LM, DR Tulu can flexibly decide which tools to invoke at inference time and, on SQAv2, primarily relies on paper search, which is free. For open models, a large fraction of the cost comes from tool-call APIs; DR Tulu is more cost-effective

Figure 5 Researching pathogenic gene variants in GeneticDiseasesQA. Left: Overall, DR Tulu-8B shows strong gains over its base model and competitive performance with closed DR models GeneticDiseasesQA, a benchmark that we constructed to reflect a real-world medical genetics task that is out-of-domain to our training data. We were unable to compare to other open deep research models and naive RAG baselines as they do not produce evidence citations, which are critical to GeneticDiseasesQA. Results for DR Tulu-8B (RL) and Qwen3-8B + Our Search are reported as the average of 10 trials. The remaining models are reported as the average of 3 trials, given the high costs and inference times for proprietary deep research systems. Right: Example question and response snippets generated by DR Tulu-8B.

because it learns to call the right tools with only the necessary frequency, rather than simply calling tools as many times as possible. Even on DRB, where DR Tulu issues more web search and browsing calls, it still remains about 10 times cheaper than Tongyi Deep Research. Overall, this suggests that using multiple complementary search tools and allowing the model to adaptively select among them can improve both prediction quality and cost efficiency.

RLER improves deep research quality across diverse aspects. We break down the performance of models on two long-form datasets, SQAv2 and DeepResearchBench in Table 3. Comparing DR Tulu (SFT) and DR Tulu (RL), we observe consistent gains from RLER across multiple aspects, including rubric coverage (+8.2 points), answer precision (+4.4), comprehensiveness (+5.4), and depth of response (+6.5). RLER also yields large improvements in citation precision and recall on SQAv2 (+23.3 and +22.1 points, respectively). These results highlight that RLER can effectively improve deep research responses along both content and attribution dimensions.

# 5.3 Application: Researching Pathogenic Gene Variants

We next applied DR Tulu to a new out-of-domain deep research task motivated by a real-world challenge in medical genetics: investigating disease-causing gene variants. In clinical settings, accurately identifying and interpreting variants on patient genetic tests is essential for diagnosing genetic disorders and recommending personalized treatment strategies (Cheerie et al., 2025). Although whole genome sequencing technologies have improved the diagnostic yield of rare genetic disease, aggregating sparse information across databases, research papers, and case reports is still a key bottleneck in variant interpretation (Mastrianni et al., 2025). This combination of information synthesis and biological reasoning, together with the need for evidence attribution and interpretability in tools for medical decision making, makes this task a natural fit for automated deep research systems.

GeneticDiseasesQA. We create a new evaluation dataset, GeneticDiseasesQA, consisting of 47 questions derived from expert-curated information about 24 disease-causing genetic variants. Question topics were centered around finding information that genetics experts use to assess the eligibility of patients with genetic variants to various gene therapy strategies (Cheerie et al., 2025), which involve reasoning about the molecular properties, disease-causing mechanisms, therapeutic approaches, etc. We show an example in Figure 5. For each question, we prompt deep research systems to generate a long-form report that both answers the question and provides supporting evidence for each claim. We define the following criteria for evaluation, again using GPT-4.1 as a judge to score each category: Final Answer indicates whether the expert-annotated fact(s) were mentioned in the response. Evidence Quality indicates if the type of evidence requested in the query (e.g.

<table><tr><td></td><td>SimpleQA</td><td>2Wiki</td><td>WebWalker</td><td>Avg.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Naive RAG</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen3-8B</td><td>52.6</td><td>18.9</td><td>8.8</td><td>26.8</td></tr><tr><td>QwQ-32B</td><td>57.2</td><td>34.2</td><td>10.1</td><td>33.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Open Deep Research (Ours)</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen3-8B + Our Search</td><td>70.5</td><td>44.0</td><td>27.9</td><td>47.5</td></tr><tr><td>DR Tulu-8B (SFT)</td><td>75.5</td><td>66.5</td><td>31.9</td><td>58.0</td></tr><tr><td>DR Tulu-8B (RL)</td><td>80.1</td><td>68.0</td><td>39.1</td><td>62.4</td></tr></table>

Table 5 Short-form results. We report short-form performance for our SFT and RL variants to analyze how each training stage affects short-form behavior. All scores are computed from top-1 predictions and evaluated with GPT-4.1 as the LLM judge under a unified evaluation pipeline, and on earlier DR Tulu (RL) checkpoint evaluated at 1000 training steps.

Evidence Synthesis indicates whether or not there was at least one statement describing the relationship between multiple sources. Evidence Support reflects the proportion of cited claims that are fully supported by the original text of the cited source. More details are in Appendix E.4.

Results. We compare DR Tulu-8B (RL) with Qwen3-8B with our search tool, Ai2 ScholarQA, Gemini 3 Pro + Gemini Search, GPT-5 + OpenAI Search, and Open AI Deep Research using o4-mini. $^{10}$  We do not include the open deep research models or fixed pipeline deep research models that do not provide citations, as it is a key aspect of the evaluation. Figure 5 reports results on the genetic variant analysis task. DR Tulu-8B consistently outperforms the base Qwen3-8B model by a large margin across all categories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our training recipe. Furthermore, DR Tulu-8B surpasses Ai2 ScholarQA Agent, which runs on top of Claude Sonnet and is specifically designed for scientific literature synthesis, and Gemini 3 Pro on overall score. DR Tulu-8B lags behind the best proprietary systems that use state-of-the-art LMs such as GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro on final-answer correctness, due to differences in underlying model capacity, though it does similarly on evidence support, and it outperforms Gemini 3 Pro on evidence support and evidence synthesis in particular. This highlights its strength in precisely synthesizing reliable sources, which is especially important for expert-domain tasks where users are more likely to scrutinize citations than blindly trust final responses. Altogether, these results show that DR Tulu-8B generalizes to real-world DR tasks that are unseen and out-of-domain to the training data.

# 6.1 Evaluation on Short-form QA Tasks

In this paper, we focus on long-form, open-ended deep research, and our RLER training is applied exclusively to long-form tasks. However, our SFT mixture deliberately includes short-form, verifiable QA tasks that still require search, so the model learns to handle both concise answers and multi-paragraph long answers. We therefore examine how well our SFT and RL models perform on standard short-form QA benchmarks to determine how well our approach generalizes to varied query types.

Datasets. Our short-form evaluation suite comprises SimpleQA (Wei et al., 2024), WebWalkerQA (Wu et al., 2025a), and 2Wiki (Ho et al., 2020). For short-form QA, we follow prior work (Li et al., 2025a; Wei et al., 2024) and use an LLM judge to determine answer correctness against the annotated gold, reporting

Figure 6 Ablation of SFT training data. We ablate SFT training data in terms of the mixture of data and scale of training data. We train models with varying sizes of SFT data (5%, 10%, 100%; 0% indicates the Qwen3-8B + dr-agent-lib results) as well as two SFT subsets, long-form data only (LF only) and short-form data only (SF only).

judge-based accuracy. We evaluate performance with Pass@1. We randomly selected 1000 questions each from SimpleQA and 2Wiki for efficient evaluation.

Results. Table 5 reports the short-form QA results. We find that DR Tulu performs competitively on short-form, verifiable QA benchmarks. Our SFT stage greatly improves over the Qwen3-8B + Our Search (dr-agent-1ib) baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of our SFT data for short-form QA. Interestingly, although the RL stage uses only long-form prompts and explicitly optimizes long-form generation quality, DR Tulu (RL) achieves further gains across datasets, improving the overall average by 4.4 points. This suggests that our RL recipe is effective not only for long-form deep research tasks, but also generalizes well to short-form QA.

# 6.2 Analysis on Training

Including both long-form and short-form SFT data is helpful. Figure 6 reports an ablation of the SFT training mixture. We analyze (i) removing the long-form or short-form subsets entirely, and (ii) subsampling the full corpus uniformly at random. Many existing open deep research models are trained only on short-form QA, assuming that short-form supervision will transfer to long-form synthesis, while other systems are optimized purely for long-form reporting and struggle to produce concise answers. Our ablations show that neither extreme is ideal: relying only on short-form or only on long-form data is suboptimal. Removing long-form data substantially degrades performance on all four long-form datasets. Conversely, removing short-form data leaves HealthBench, ResearchQA, and DRB largely unchanged, but noticeably reduces performance on 2Wiki and SQAv2. This suggests that short-form supervision alone does not automatically

Table 6 Ablation on rubrics. We ablate the rubrics used during RL training, and the effect of adding evolving rubrics. We find that using simple rubrics can actually hurt performance, while search-based rubrics perform best. Further adding evolving rubrics gives a one point improvement on average. For expensive training costs, we stopped this ablation after 650 steps and switched to training with evolving rubrics for longer. SFT v0.1 and v0.2 refer to different intermediate SFT mixtures developed during the project, which used similar mixtures to our final SFT checkpoint.

yield strong long-form, open-ended, deep research performance. Although our primary focus is long-form deep research, we retain a modest short-form component so that the model remains more general-purpose and handles short-form questions well, without sacrificing long-form performance.

SFT scaling: saturated gains for long-form, continued gains for short-form. All tasks show clear gains as we initially increase the amount of SFT data. On 2Wiki, performance continues to improve up to  $100\%$  of the data, suggesting that short-form tasks may benefit more directly from scaling SFT data. On long-form tasks, we already observe substantial gains with just  $5\%$  of the training data, indicating that even a relatively small amount of high-quality long-form trajectory data is highly beneficial. However, improvements saturate after  $50\%$ , highlighting that, unlike short-form QA, further boosting deep research agent performance on open-ended tasks is challenging if we only scale SFT data. While we observed a slight drop in SQAv2 from using the full SFT dataset, we found this was largely driven by citation scores dropping, while ingredient and answer-based metrics remained similar.[11] As such, we used the full-size SFT dataset to maintain strong short-form QA abilities, and as we found, RL training was able to significantly recover SQAv2 citation performance.

RL benefits from stronger SFT models and longer training. We ablate the effect of using different SFT cold start datasets on RL in Figure 7, tracing performance up to 600 training steps. Beginning RL directly from Qwen3 (no SFT cold start) dramatically improves scores over Qwen3-8B with no training, but still underperforms using even a small amount of high-quality SFT data (5% of our full mixture) as cold-start data for the RL training. Using a larger amount of SFT data (i.e., our full SFT mixture) further improves performance. We additionally explore augmenting the SFT data with an extra "on-policy" SFT stage. Specifically, we run our trained model on randomly sampled prompts, apply rejection sampling to discard trajectories that do not achieve high scores on search-based rubric verification and citation verification (details in Appendix C.3), and then use the remaining trajectories for further SFT. While this slightly boosts SFT model performance, we find it ultimately weakens performance later on during RL training, underperforming using our regular SFT mixture on Healthbench and SQAv2. We also found that extended RL training was crucial to performance: in some cases, evaluations that initially seemed flat (e.g., DRB) improved with extended RL training up to 1000 and even 1900 steps. We also note that we found that higher train reward (i.e., reward during RL training) did not necessarily match with higher downstream reward, see Appendix F.5 for details. Finally, we also find that our training is robust to tool errors, with the model improving in performance even after training for an extended time with a tool consistently erroring – see Appendix F.1 for details and the full RL training curves.

Search-based rubrics outperform closed-book rubrics. We ablate the effect of using different static rubric setups (i.e., without adding evolving rubrics) during RL training in Table 6. We run RL training for 500 steps

on top of an intermediate SFT checkpoint using four different rubric setups: (1) general rubrics, in which we use a simple prompt and LM judge to score model outputs (see Appendix D.3 for prompt); (2) closed-book rubrics, which are generated without access to any search information; (3) search-based rubrics, which are generated with knowledge from an initial search (See Section 3 for details). For these runs, we only used training samples from OpenScholar. We find that using search-based rubrics performs best overall, while using a single general rubric for all samples actually results in lower performance than the SFT starting point.

Evolving rubrics improve over initial rubrics alone. We additionally ablate using evolving rubrics on top of search-based rubrics in Table 6, training for 650 steps (due to compute and budget limitations) over an intermediate SFT checkpoint. We find that using evolving rubrics during training can provide a boost over search rubrics alone in all long-form evaluations except Healthbench. We expect that this gap would further widen with longer training, as evolving rubrics further capture new knowledge explored by the model.

# 6.3 Analysis on Inference

Tool and domain usage adapt to each task's information needs. Figure 8 shows that paper_search (our scientific-paper search) dominates on SQAv2, consistent with its focus on literature understanding. In contrast, Google Search is the primary tool for HealthBench, DeepResearchBench, and SimpleQA, reflecting the broader, open-web information needs of these tasks. web_browse is used comparatively less across all datasets, serving as a follow-up tool for reading full pages when snippet context is insufficient.

Figure 9 further confirms task-specific retrieval behavior. HealthBench emphasizes authoritative biomedical and public-health sites (e.g., cdc.gov, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, mayoclinic.org). DeepResearchBench mixes technical and policy sources (e.g., researchgate.net, oecd.org, github.com), consistent with deeper, exploratory research tasks. SimpleQA is dominated by general reference and social/information platforms (e.g., en.wikipedia.org, facebook.com, youtube.com). Overall, tool usage and surfaced domains align with each dataset's information demands: literature-centric tasks favor scientific search and scholarly venues, whereas open-domain tasks lean on general web search and broad reference sites.

# 7 Related Work

Deep research agents. Rapid adoption of commercial deep research systems has spurred numerous open efforts, but most target verifiable, short-form generation (e.g., factoid QA or lightweight web-browsing tasks). Inspired by the success of scaling online RL on verifiable domains such as code and math, many methods follow a similar recipe. For example, Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025) applies GRPO to enhance search capabilities and is trained primarily on short-form question answering. Such approaches have been explored in many recent followup studies, including WebExplorer (Liu et al., 2025) and Tongyi Deep Research (Team et al., 2025). In contrast, WebThinker (Li et al., 2025a) employs DPO and proposes a report-generation workflow. Nevertheless, the majority of these works train and evaluate only on short-form outputs. Furthermore, most open deep research systems either rely on a single web search tool or train separate models per search backend (Gao et al., 2025), except for the latest Tongyi Deep Research, which includes Google Scholar API (Team et al., 2025) as a tool. In expert domains (e.g., healthcare, science), we find that combining multiple search tools yields substantial gains. In addition, existing open systems typically omit explicit citations, unlike proprietary counterparts.

Furthermore, many of these models do not fully open-source their training data or training codebases, making it difficult to further analyze or improve their training. A complementary line of work builds deep research agents by carefully designing fixed long-form generation pipelines, often on top of state-of-the-art proprietary models, including WebWeaver (Li et al., 2025b), SFT-Enterprise Deep Research (Prabhakar et al., 2025), and

Ai2 ScholarQA (Singh et al., 2025). Leveraging strong backbone LMs, these systems overcome some of the aforementioned limitations and are evaluated primarily on long-form generation tasks. However, their fixed pipelines sacrifice flexibility in inference flow and output style (e.g., always producing long-form reports even for simple factoid questions), and they still do not provide a clear path toward open, end-to-end trainable deep research models.

Table 7 summarizes these gaps. To our knowledge, our system is the first fully open deep research framework that (i) is trained and rigorously evaluated on realistic long-form tasks, (ii) natively supports multi-tool search rather than single-tool or siloed models, and (iii) produces evidence-linked citations. Furthermore, even among open deep research models, some prior studies do not fully release their training data, as shown in Table 7. We fully open-source our training and evaluation code bases, data, and a new infrastructure to support flexible deep research agent developments.

Rubric design for long-form generation tasks. Prior work uses human-written rubrics for evaluation (Arora et al., 2025; Asai et al., 2024), but it is costly and not scalable when applied for training. RaR (Gunjal et al., 2025) proposed to use rubrics as rewards and generate instance-wise rubrics based on reference answers from an advanced model (OpenAI o3). However, these rubrics are static and usually generated by the same model, which can only slow down reward hacking but does not resolve the issue. In addition, these approaches rely on the capabilities of the model used to generate reference answers, whose knowledge is limited and not up to date, and thus cannot meet the needs of DR tasks. Our evolving rubrics are generated based on retrieved knowledge, echoing EvalAgent (Wadhwa et al., 2025), which uses search to construct better evaluation criteria for benchmarks. Concurrent works (Rezaei et al., 2025; Jayalath et al., 2025) explore generating online rubrics by contrasting pairwise or multiple model rollouts in a closed-book setting. This approach echoes the design principle of our evolving rubrics but lacks grounding in external knowledge, which leads to exploitation (reshaping model behavior based solely on its internal knowledge) rather than exploration (integrating new external knowledge while also exploiting existing knowledge). Another concurrent work, RLAC (Wu et al., 2025b), explores training a critic to propose a likely incorrect fact that serves a similar role to a rubric for factuality tasks. Compared with concurrent works, our approach focuses on a more challenging setup—DR tasks—and generates rubrics that both co-evolve with the policy model and remain grounded in external knowledge, enabling prolonged RL training with an evolving verifier.

# 8 Discussion and Future Work

In conclusion, we highlight key insights, challenges, and promising directions for future work.

Evolving rubrics adapt the verifier based on the policy model's capabilities. At each training step, we update our rubrics by contrasting the model's current rollouts, which helps the new rubric criteria better distinguish those outputs. We can view this as making the training difficulty adaptive to the model's evolving behavior. This approach aligns with the idea of training in adaptive environments, which has been previously explored by adjusting prompts during training (Zeng et al., 2025). In contrast, we adapt the environment by updating the verifier (rubrics). Future work may consider jointly adapting both prompts and rubric criteria to further improve training efficiency.

A new dimension of scaling verifier compute: providing more privileged information to the judge. Another perspective on RLER is that it creates a new way to scale the compute used by the verifier. While prior work focuses on increasing the reasoning tokens used by the reward model, often grounded in limited context (Guo et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b), we instead focus on enriching the information available to the verifier. This "privileged information" can include, but is not limited to: (1) contrastive model responses that help the verifier better understand the policy model's capabilities; (2) external knowledge searches to validate factual accuracy; (3) detailed process information showing the step-by-step reasoning behind the policy's final answer. While scaling up this information often increases context length and compute costs, it can extend the verifier's capabilities far beyond what infinite reasoning tokens alone can achieve, leading to more informed and meaningful decisions under a fixed compute budget.

Evolving rubrics can also be interpreted from the perspective of increasing knowledge coverage. Figure 10 shows an abstract visualization of the knowledge coverage of different rubric types. Search expands the knowledge covered by the rubrics beyond the parametric knowledge of the rubric generator (an LM). Furthermore, evolving rubrics generated during training fold in new evidence discovered by the deep research policy during training rollouts, capturing knowledge that requires complex reasoning and planning to obtain, and allowing the evaluation criteria to evolve with the model's distribution.

The train-test mismatch challenge. When developing DR Tulu, we found that models that achieved the highest training reward did not necessarily achieve the highest downstream evaluation performance, although within the same run, higher training rewards usually correlated with better downstream performance; see Appendix F.5 for more details. We conjecture that this stems from a mismatch between the tasks, rubrics, and evaluation setups of the external benchmarks vs. what we used for training. For instance, RL training uses a judge that differs from the judges used in downstream evaluations, which can lead to reward hacking toward preferences specific to the training-time judge. Moreover, external benchmarks often use expert-crafted or generated rubrics that may emphasize aspects not captured in our

training rubrics. Some rubrics may not be clear from the question alone, making it challenging for models not trained on specific benchmarks. This underscores the value of fully open DR models like DR Tulu, which can be easily customized for downstream tasks.

Adaptation to specialized domains. Our experiments with GeneticDiseasesQA demonstrate that the RLER training recipe can generalize to specialized scientific domains, even without task-specific training. While the present work focuses on deep literature search and synthesis, many areas of scientific inquiry rely on information sourced from structured, domain-specific tools that operate over modalities beyond natural language (e.g., genomic sequences, molecular structures, transcriptomics, etc.). Incorporating these specialized data sources into training—or, better yet, training the model to flexibly use previously unseen tools just in time—would be a natural next step that permits the extension of DR Tulu to more complex scientific workflows.

# A Additional Details of RLER

# A.1 Evolving Rubric Generation Prompt

We show the instruction we used for evolving rubric generation in Figure 11 and Figure 12.

# A.2 Rubric Reward Judge Prompt

We show the rubric-judge prompt in Figure 13. Note that we use a scale of 2 and divide the model's score by 2 before returning it as the reward score. We omitted this detail from the main paper for simplicity. We leave exploring different scoring scales to future work.

# A.3 Citation, Search, and Format Rewards

In this section, we detail the implementations of citation, search, and format rewards that are used as auxiliary rewards in RLER. We refer to the code for detailed implementations and prompts.

# A.3.1 Citation Reward Design

Citation Reward Given a query  $x \in \mathcal{D}$  and a response  $y \sim \pi_{\theta}(\cdot |x)$ , we evaluate citations with respect to a citation store  $S = \{(i, s_i)\}$  mapping citation IDs  $i$  to snippets  $s_i$ . We first extract a set of claims from  $y$ ,

$$
\mathcal {C} = \left\{c _ {1}, \dots , c _ {| \mathcal {C} |} \right\} = \operatorname {E x t r a c t C l a i m s} (y),
$$

with an associated (possibly empty) set of cited IDs for each claim,

$$
I (c) \subseteq \{i \}, \qquad c \in \mathcal {C}.
$$

Citation-format reward. We reward valid citations by the fraction that resolve in  $S$ :

$$
R _ {\mathrm {f m t}} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \frac {\left| \bigcup_ {c \in \mathcal {C}} I (c) \cap \mathrm {k e y s} (\mathcal {S}) \right|}{\left| \bigcup_ {c \in \mathcal {C}} I (c) \right|}, & \left| \bigcup_ {c} I (c) \right| > 0, \\ 0, & \text {o t h e r w i s e}. \end{array} \right.
$$

Per-claim recall and precision. For each claim  $c$ , we define the concatenated evidence

$$
E (c) = \bigoplus_ {i \in I (c)} s _ {i},
$$

and obtain two LLM-judge signals:

Recall. If  $I(c) \neq \emptyset$ , the judge rates support of  $c$  by  $E(c)$  as Fully = 1, Partially = 0.5, No = 0. Denote this by  $r(c) \in \{1, 0.5, 0\}$ . If  $I(c) = \emptyset$ , we ask whether  $c$  needs a citation given  $(x, y)$ . Let NeedCite  $(c) \in \{0, 1\}$ . Then

$$
r (c) = 1 - \operatorname {N e e d C i t e} (c).
$$

Precision. If  $I(c) \neq \emptyset$ , the judge checks whether  $E(c)$  is relevant to  $c$ : Relevant = 1, Irrelevant = 0. Denote this by  $p(c) \in \{1, 0\}$ . If  $I(c) = \emptyset$ , we set  $p(c) = 1$ .

Per-claim F1.

$$
f (c) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \frac {2   r (c)   p (c)}{r (c) + p (c)}, & r (c) + p (c) > 0, \\ 0, & \text {o t h e r w i s e}. \end{array} \right.
$$

Average F1.

$$
\overline {{F _ {1}}} = \frac {1}{| \mathcal {C} |} \sum_ {c \in \mathcal {C}} f (c).
$$

Final reward. We combine faithfulness (via  $\overline{F_1}$ ) and format validity (via  $R_{\mathrm{fmt}}$ ) with fixed weights:

$$
r _ {\mathrm {c i t}} (x, y) = 0. 6 \overline {{F _ {1}}} + 0. 4 R _ {\mathrm {f m t}}, \quad r _ {\mathrm {c i t}} (x, y) \in [ 0, 1 ].
$$

# Evolving Rubric Generation Prompt (Part 1)

You are an expert evaluator generating adaptive rubrics to assess model responses.

# Task

Identify the most discriminative criteria that distinguish high-quality from low-quality answers. Capture subtle quality differences that existing rubrics miss.

# Output Components

- **Description**: Detailed, specific description of what makes a response excellent/problematic  
- **Title**: Concise abstract label (general, not question-specific)

# Categories

1. **Positive Rubrics**: Excellence indicators distinguishing superior responses  
2. **Negative Rubrics**: Critical flaws definitively degrading quality

## Core Guidelines

# 1. Discriminative Power

- Focus ONLY on criteria meaningfully separating quality levels  
- Each rubric must distinguish between otherwise similar responses  
- Exclude generic criteria applying equally to all responses

# 2. Novelty & Non-Redundancy

With existing/ground truth rubrics:

- Never duplicate overlapping rubrics in meaning/scope  
- Identify uncovered quality dimensions  
- Add granular criteria if existing ones are broad  
- Return empty lists if existing rubrics are comprehensive

# 3. Avoid Mirror Rubrics

Never create positive/negative versions of same criterion:

- "Provides clear explanations" + "Lacks clear explanations"  
- Choose only the more discriminative direction

# 4. Conservative Negative Rubrics

- Identify clear failure modes, not absence of excellence  
- Response penalized if it exhibits ANY negative rubric behavior  
- Focus on active mistakes vs missing features

Selection Strategy

Quantity: 1-5 total rubrics (fewer high-quality > many generic)

# Distribution Based on Response Patterns:

- **More positive**: Responses lack sophistication but avoid major errors  
- **More negative**: Systematic failure patterns present  
- **Balanced**: Both excellence gaps and failure modes exist  
- \*\*Empty lists\*\*: Existing rubrics already comprehensive

# ## Analysis Process

1. Group responses by quality level  
2. Find factors separating higher/ lower clusters  
3. Check if factors covered by existing rubrics  
4. Select criteria with highest discriminative value

Inputs

1. **Question**: Original question being answered  
2. **Responses**: Multiple model responses (Response 1, Response 2, etc.)  
3. **Existing Rubrics** (optional): Previously generated/ground truth rubrics

## Critical Reminders

- Each rubric must distinguish between actual provided responses  
- Exclude rubrics applying equally to all responses  
- Prefer empty lists over redundancy when existing rubrics are comprehensive  
- Focus on observable, objective, actionable criteria  
- Quality over quantity: 2 excellent rubrics > 5 mediocre ones

Generate only the most impactful, non-redundant rubrics revealing meaningful quality differences.

# Rubric Judge Prompt

You will be given a question someone asked (in <question></question> tags) and the corresponding response (in <response></response> tags) given to them by an assistant. You will then be given a specific criterion of the response to evaluate (in <criterion></criterion> tags).  
Return a score on a scale of 0 to 2 indicating how appropriate the response is based on the given criterion. Judge only the specified aspect(s), not any other qualities of the answer. Output JSON in the format: {{"score": x}}.

```txt
<question>{question}</question> <response>{response}</response> <criterion>{rubric}</criterion>
```

Figure 13 System prompt for rubric reward computation.

# A.3.2 Search Reward Design

To encourage the model to engage in multi-turn information gathering, we introduce a search reward that scores the number of search tool calls made during generation. Specifically, we extract all search queries issued by the model (identified by search protocol tokens in the generated text) and count the number of valid, non-empty queries. The reward is computed as the ratio of the number of searches performed to an upper bound (set to 3 in our experiments), capped at 1.0. This design incentivizes the model to conduct multiple searches to gather diverse information sources, while preventing unbounded reward accumulation.

# A.3.3 Format Reward Design

Beyond rubric-based and citation-specific rewards, we introduce lightweight auxiliary rewards that encourage structural correctness of responses with respect to the expected output schema.

Given a response  $y$  to a query  $x$ , we check for the presence of three components:

1. Answer format. Whether  $y$  encloses a final answer between <answer></answer> tags, producing a binary indicator  $a(y) \in \{0, 1\}$ .  
2. Citation format. Whether  $y$  contains at least one citation enclosed in  $<\text{cite}>$ / $<\text{cite}>$  tags, producing  $c(y) \in \{0,1\}$ .  
3. Query format. Whether  $y$  includes at least one valid search query enclosed in  $<\text{query}></\text{query}>$  tags (or parser-specific equivalents), producing  $q(y) \in \{0,1\}$ .

We then define a weighted format reward as

$$
r _ {\mathrm {f m t}} (x, y) = 0. 5 a (y) + 0. 3 c (y) + 0. 2 q (y), \quad r _ {\mathrm {f m t}} (x, y) \in [ 0, 1 ].
$$

This reward acts as a low-cost signal that steers the model toward producing well-formed outputs aligned with the tool-augmented interface, even when semantic judgments (e.g., citation recall or rubric alignment) are unavailable.

# B RLER Analysis and Toy Case Study

In this section, we provide additional experimental details for the RLER analysis and toy case study discussed in Section 3.3.

# B.1 Rubric Specificity Analysis

To evaluate the specificity level of generated rubrics, we instruct an LM to first classify whether the rubric is assertive as defined in Section 3.3 and, if it is assertive, whether it is factual. As this task requires the LM to have knowledge that is enough to check the factuality, we apply a search-based API model—GPT-4O-SEARCH-PREVIEW—which has access to OpenAI internal search tool, which is not as competitive as a Deep Research model but is helpful enough for simple fact check. We use the prompt presented in Figure 14 to obtain the assertive rubric fraction and factuality scores.

# B.2 Toy Case Study on Evolving Rubrics

To study the impact of an evolving rubric in RL runs over more training epochs, we perform a toy case study in a closed-book LM setup (where the policy model is not instructed to use tools and must answer on its own). Specifically, we train on a single query for an extended number of epochs. The query asks "Write a comprehensive survey paper about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the latest progress in the field, e.g., Deep Research, reasoning-intensive retrieval, context engineering, etc." We train from Qwen3-8B using the same set of hyper-parameters as our main RL training as described in Appendix D.2. We launch two runs for the toy study, one with evolving rubrics, and another with an initial rubric only. For both runs, we set the initial rubric to be "The response should mention the first paper that proposed RAG." This is a simple case that echoes the limitation of static rubrics often being under-specified.

In Figure 15, we show one example output from the policy model that exhibits undesirable code reasoning behavior in our toy case training.

# C.1.1 Prompt curation

Long-form prompt curation. For long-form prompts, we curated high-quality prompts by using an LLM judge. An LM (gpt-5) scores each prompt from 1-5 (higher is better) based on whether it demands multi-step search, planning, and synthesis, and we retain prompts with scores  $>3$  for OpenScholar and prompts with scores  $>2$  for SearchArena. Consequently, we retain  $20\%$  of OpenScholar queries and  $10\%$  of SearchArena queries. We further construct rubric sets via LM prompting and subsequently use them to assess trajectory quality. Figure 16 presents the system prompt used to select queries.

Short-form prompt curation. For short-form, we derive initial questions from widely open-sourced data including MegaScience (Fan et al., 2025), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), TaskCraft (Shi et al., 2025), WebWalkerSilver (Wu et al., 2025a), PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022), and TyDi QA (Clark et al., 2020). We also used GPT-4.1 to generate 916 BrowseComp (Wei et al., 2025) style questions.

# C.1.2 Trajectory Generation

Given the set of initial prompts, we generate high-quality trajectories data using three different teacher models. Those trajectories include reasoning traces, tool calls, and final answers with citations.

Trajectory generation with GPT-5. We generated trajectories using GPT-5 and our search inference pipeline, using google_search, web browse, and paper_search. Figure 17 shows the exact prompt that was used. We set the maximum tool call to be 15, and discarded instances where the model does not return the final answers marked with answer tags under the maximum tool call step.

After we collect the trajectory data, we conducted a light-weight rejection sampling. Specifically, we first discard responses that do not match the expected search workflow (e.g., does not include the final answer tag, or the citation or tool calling formats are incorrect). Then, for short-form, verifiable QA only, we apply answer-matching based rejection sampling: we keep examples only if the final answers match the original

# Prompt for Assertive Fraction and Factuality Analysis

You are a careful evaluator who determines whether each criterion contains a factual claim, and if so, whether that claim is factually correct and verifiable.

# Instructions:

1. Read the question and the list of criteria carefully.  
2. For each criterion, decide first whether it *makes a factual claim* - that is, whether it asserts something that can be verified as true or false in the real world.

**Distinguishing referential vs. assertive phrasing:**

- Referential  $(\rightarrow$  NA): Criteria that only ask to *mention*, *explain*, *describe*,  
*discuss*, or *include information about* something, without specifying what that information should be. These refer to factual topics but do not assert any particular fact.

- Example: 'Explain the principle of masked diffusion models.'  $\rightarrow$  NA (requests explanation, not asserting the content).

- Example: 'Mention information about A.'  $\rightarrow$  NA.

- Assertive ( $\rightarrow$  factual claim): Criteria that *state or imply a specific fact*, relationship, or property that could be true or false. They assert content, not just reference it.

- Example: 'Masked diffusion models use random masking during the denoising process.'  $\rightarrow$  factual claim.  
- Example: 'A is located in B.'  $\rightarrow$  factual claim.

3. If the criterion is about writing style, tone, clarity, structure, or formatting, or if it only requires mentioning or explaining topics without specifying factual assertions, return 'NA'.  
4. For each factual claim, check whether it can be verified using reliable evidence or reasoning.

- If evidence confirms it  $\rightarrow$  factual and correct.  
- If reliable evidence contradicts it  $\rightarrow$  factual but incorrect.  
- If no verifiable evidence is found (e.g., no data, no known sources)  $\rightarrow$  factual but *unverified*.

5. Compute the factuality score as:

-  $1 \rightarrow$  All verifiable factual claims are correct.  
- Between 0 and  $1 \rightarrow$  Some verifiable factual claims are correct, others are incorrect (average them).  
-  $0 \to$  All verifiable factual claims are incorrect.  
- 'NA'  $\rightarrow$  None of the criteria makes any factual claims.

6. Do *not* lower the score for claims that are unverified (i.e., lacking evidence) unless there is evidence showing they are *false*.  
7. Also count how many criteria are assertive but unverified.

# Output Format:

Return your result strictly in JSON format as follows:

{{"factual_score": <float_or_"NA"', "explanation": "<short explanation>",

"num_non_na criteria": <number>, "num_na criteria": <number>,

"num_unverified_assertivecriteria":<number>}]

Now evaluate the following:

Question: {question}

Criteria: {criteria}

# Query Selection Prompt

You are a query-quality grader for Search-Augmented LLMs.

# Your job:

Given ONE user query (English only) from Search Arena, decide whether to SKIP or GRADE it for retrieval-oriented quality.

Dataset facts you may rely on (if provided):

- Each record contains chat histories `messages_a` and `messages_b`; the FIRST message in each is from the user and is the query we grade.  
- Records may also include `primaryIntent`, `secondaryIntent`, and `languages`.  
- If `primary目的在于` is `creative_generation` or `others`, SKIP.  
- If the query is not English, SKIP.

(If fields are missing, infer from the query text.)

What counts as a high-quality search query?

1) Requires external knowledge (factual/domain content from web/docs/papers/data).  
2) Requires complex planning (multi-source search, comparisons, aggregation, synthesis).  
3) Often expects long-form responses.  
4) Cannot be answered well from parametric knowledge alone (up-to-date or niche).  
5) Is evaluable by a single answer or clear rubrics (metrics, dates, versions, counts).

# Safety:

- Must be safe: no PII harvesting, disallowed instructions, or offensive content.

Scoring (integers only):

1 = Trivial/chit-chat; no retrieval; not evaluable.  
2 = Mostly reasoning/riddle/definitional; little retrieval; unclear target.  
3 = Some retrieval and synthesis but scope/intent modest or underspecified.  
$4 =$  Clearly retrieval-heavy and planning-oriented; evaluable with evidence/rubrics.  
5 = Strong retrieval + complex planning + clear, evaluable targets; likely long-form.

Few-shot demonstrations (for guidance only; DO NOT copy or echo these in outputs):

- Query: who is ion vlad-doru -> Score: 3  
Rationale: Factual knowledge and retrieval helps, but simple entity lookup; limited planning.  
- Query: hello -> Score: 1

Rationale: Chit-chat; no external knowledge or evaluable target.  
- Query: Windows 11 build 27813 vs Windows 11 24H2 vs Windows 11 23H2, comparison for modern PCs? -> Score: 3

Rationale: Requires searching and synthesis across versions/builds; intent mostly clear but scope (what counts as "modern PCs") needs clarification.

- Query: I'm an even, single-digit number. Once you write me, I have no start or end. I look like a standing pair of glasses. Who am I? -> Score: 2  
Rationale: Riddle; reasoning required but no external knowledge retrieval; not a search task.  
- Query: best running watch -> Score: 3

Rationale: Retrieval and synthesis likely; intent clear but underspecified; could be rubricized (features, price, ecosystem).  
- Query: what is SWE-Bench state of the art at the moment? -> Score: 4

Rationale: Up-to-date SOTA requires extensive retrieval (papers/leaderboards); evaluable by metrics; planning needed.

- Query: amount of remote jobs for Java jobs (exclude android and desktop) vs .Net vs GoLang vs NodeJS in EU? Please note UK is not in EU -> Score: 5

Rationale: Complex planning with constraints, aggregation across sources/regions, and clearly evaluable counts/methodology.

gold answers, based on (1) if the F1 overlap between the predicted answer and the gold answer exceeds 0.9, or (2) if an LLM judge deems the two answers are semantically identical. Figures 31-34 show examples of generated trajectories.

We also use GPT-5 with google_search and webBX browse to generate a few hundred interleaved search and think trajectories for BrowseComp-style questions.

Trajectory generations using Ai2 ScholarQA. We used the trajectory data from Ai2 ScholarQA to create SFT data. Ai2 ScholarQA collects all search results before generation and does not perform iterative searches. To create synthetic data with iterative searches, we transformed the data provided in the Ai2 ScholarQA traces. Each trace consists of retrieved results, CoT planning steps, and an answer with citations. We used GPT-4.1 to create a sub-query for each section in the Ai2 ScholarQA. The sub-query was generated conditioned on the section text and retrieved papers cited in the section. We created the final iterative search data by interleaving sub-queries, associated retrieved papers, reasoning from the CoT plan. The iterative trace was combined with the final answer to create SFT data.

Data stats. Table 8 shows the final statistics of the resulting SFT data.

Example of SFT data. Figures 31-34 show an example trajectory of OpenScholar in our SFT data.

# C.2 RL Data Construction

Initial rubric constructions. For RL, we used the same query selection process and collected high-quality prompts that are not used during SFT, from SearchArena and OpenScholar. For each prompt, we generate initial set of rubrics, using external search systems. Specifically, for OpenScholar queries, we use paper search (S2 snippet search) and for SearchArena queries, we use google search (serper search) and web browsing (serper browse) to retrieve top 10 search results. Given the retrieved documents, we generate a set of initial rubrics. The system prompts for this is in Figure 18. We used GPT-4.1-mini as the rubric generation model.

# C.3 Onpolicy SFT Data Construction

We also generate on-policy SFT data by sampling trajectories from our SFT checkpoint and applying rejection sampling. While this improves the standalone performance of the SFT model, we initialize RL from the original SFT checkpoint instead, as our preliminary experiments suggest that starting from a slightly weaker SFT model ultimately leads to higher overall performance after RL.

Trajectory generation. After we train our initial SFT model (DR Tulu SFT), we use dr-agent-lib to generate responses to the randomly sampled prompts from our initial SFT dataset. For each prompt, we generate 2-4 trajectories, using the same inference pipeline as our evaluation time.

# Trajectory Generation Prompt

You are a research assistant that answers questions through iterative reasoning and evidence-backed search using multiple external search systems.

# 1. Operating Principles, Process & Guidelines

# 1.1 Principles

- Provide comprehensive, evidence-backed answers to scientific questions.  
- Ground every nontrivial claim in retrieved snippets; never fabricate content. Cite using <cite id="...">.</cite> drawn only from returned snippets.  
- Prefer authoritative sources (peer-reviewed papers, reputable benchmarks/docs) and prioritize recent work for fast-moving areas.  
- Acknowledge uncertainty and conflicts; if evidence is thin or sources disagree, state it and explain what additional evidence would resolve it.  
- Structure with clear Markdown headers and a coherent flow. In each section, write 2-5 sentence paragraphs with clear topic sentences and transitions; use lists sparingly only when they improve clarity.  
- Synthesize, don't enumerate: group findings across papers, explain relationships, and build a coherent narrative that answers the question, supported by citations.  
- Do not invent snippets or citations. Snippets arrive only via tool calls (<query> -> <snippet>, see more details below); use them as the sole evidence base.

# 1.2 Process and Iteration loop (at least search four times)

1) **Initial plan** - Begin with a `<think>` that decomposes the question, lists assumptions, outlines a concrete search plan (start broad -> ablations/benchmarks -> domain-specific; include venues/years), and defines the first query.  
2) **Query -> Snippets -> Think** - For each iteration:

- Run a `<call_tool>` and read the returned `<snippet>` results.  
- Then add a `<think>` (natural prose) that:

- Summarizes what the latest snippets show; marks which are relevant vs. irrelevant **and why**.  
- Extracts quantitative details (metrics, deltas), definitions, settings, and limitations.

- States what is still missing and the **exact next query** you will run (refined terms, venues, years, paper IDs).

- Prefer `snippets_search` for paragraph-level evidence. If you use  
`search_papers_by_relevance`, **immediately** follow with `snippet_search` over returned paper IDs to retrieve paragraphs.  
- Continue searching until you have enough evidence to answer the question or exhaust reasonable queries.

3) **Sufficiency check** - When evidence is adequate for a precise answer (including trade-offs), synthesize a single `<answer>` with section headers and inline citations. Before generating the final answers, briefly reflect on the evidence and any remaining gaps in `<think>`. Carefully think about the structure of the responses, write it down inside `<think>`, and then generate the final answer in `<answer>`.

... (Guideline, few shot demonstrations, and tool call details)

Figure 17 System prompt for generating trajectory data.

# Trajectory Generation Prompt

You will receive: (1) a user Question that tests literature knowledge, and (2) a list of Snippets (each with an id and text).  
Your task: design a rubric - a compact set of elements ("ingredients") that a high-quality final answer should satisfy, and map each element to the most relevant snippets.

Important: You are specifying what a *good answer must contain*, not grading any existing answer. Use ONLY the provided snippets for evidence.

# INPUT FORMAT

```yaml
- Question: a single string.
- Snippets: a list of items. Each item has:
  - id: a unique identifier (e.g., S_abcd123, DOI/CorpusID, or similar).
  - text: the snippet content (the ONLY citable text).
```

# WHAT TO RETURN

```txt
Return a single JSON object with EXACTLY these top-level keys:  
{ "Question": <string>, "Answer Critical": [ { "Ingredient": <string>, "Handle": <string>, "Specifics": [ { "Text": <string>, "Citation": <id> } ... ]} ], "Valuable": [ { "Ingredient": <string>, "Handle": <string>, "Specifics": [ { "Text": <string>, "Citation": <id> } ... ]} ], "Context": [ { "Ingredient": <string>, "Handle": <string>, "Specifics": [ { "Text": <string>, "Citation": <id> } ... ]} ]}
```

# INGREDIENT BUDGET & DIFFICULTY

```txt
- Include at least  $**5$  "Answer Critical"* elements (ideally more); use "Valuable" and/or "Context" only if genuinely needed.  
- Make each element **detailed and challenging**: it should bundle multiple precise, testable requirements for the same capability (multi-criteria), not broad or vague checks.  
- Make each element **detailed and challenging**: write it as a **multi-criteria** requirement (multiple precise, testable sub-checks for a single capability).
```

Rejection sampling. After collecting trajectories, we apply rejection sampling. In addition to the lightweight procedure described in Appendix C.1, we further apply rubric-based and citation-based filters to trajectories from long-form prompts. Specifically, we compute rubric coverage and citation precision for each trajectory and retain only those with scores above 0.6 on both metrics. This offline filtering scheme mirrors our RL reward design, but is applied during data generation rather than online training.

# DR Tulu System Prompt Part I

You are a research assistant who answers questions through iterative reasoning and research.

# ## Process

- Use <think></think> tags to show your reasoning at any point.  
- Use <call_tool name="...">query</call_tool> when you need information (see tools below).  
- You can alternate between thinking and searching multiple times.  
- Only provide <answer></answer> tags when you have enough information for a complete response. If the problem asks for a specific, short-form answer, you can also put the answer string in the \boxed{} format.  
- Support every non-trivial claim with retrieved evidence. Wrap the exact claim span in <cite id="ID1,ID2">...</cite>, where id are snippet IDs from searched results (comma-separated if multiple). Use only returned snippets; never invent IDs. Avoid citing filler text - cite just the factual claim.

```java
## Calling Tools (<call_tool name="..." query></call_tool>)

- You can use the following tools:

# 1. google_search

- Purpose: general web search.  
- Input via: <call_tool name="google_search">your query</call_tool>  
- Output: web search snippets (see SEARCH RESULTS).  
- Optional parameters

- gl: geolocation  
- hl: host language

# 2. browse_webpage

- Purpose: open a specific URL (typically one returned by google_search) and extract readable page text as snippets.  
- Input via: <call_tool name="browse_webpage">https://example.com/article</call_tool>  
- Output: webpage (see SEARCH RESULTS).

# 3. snippet_search

- Purpose: focused snippet retrieval from scientific papers  
- Input via: <call_tool name="snippet_search">your query</call_tool>  
- Output: snippets from existing papers (see SEARCH RESULTS).  
- Examples: <call_tool name="snippet_search" limit="8" year="2021-2025"

fieldsOfStudy="Computer Science, Medicine">large language model retrieval evaluation</call_tool>

# - Optional parameters

- limit: number of snippets to retrieve  
- year: publication year; you can use a single number (e.g., 2024) or a range (e.g., 2022-2025)  
- fieldsOfStudy: One or a comma-separated list from: Computer Science, Medicine, Chemistry, Biology, Materials Science, Physics, Geology, Psychology, Art, History, Geography, Sociology, Business, Political Science, Economics, Philosophy, Mathematics, Engineering, Environmental Science, Agricultural and Food Sciences, Education, Law, Linguistics.

# ## Tool Output

- After you issue a tool call, we will execute it and return results wrapped in <tool_output> tags.  
- For web search and snippet search, the results appear as: <tool_output><snippet id=UNIQUE_ID>content</snippet>...</tool_output>  
- For web browsing, the searched results are represented as <tool_output><webpage id=UNIQUE_ID>content</webpage></tool_output>

Figure 20 DR Tulu System Prompts Part I.

# DR Tulu System Prompt Part II

Answer and Citation Format

- Once you collect all of the necessary information, generate the final answer, and mark your answer with answer tags: <answer></answer>.  
- If your answer is short (e.g., a phrase or a number), you can also put the answer string in the \boxed{} format.  
- In your answer, wrap the supported text in <cite id="SNIPPET_ID"> ... </cite>. You have to use the exact ID from a returned <snippet id=...>...</snippet>.  
- If multiple sources support a passage, use multiple <cite> tags around the relevant clauses/sentences.  
- Examples

<cite id="S17">LLMs often hallucinate on long-tail facts.</cite>
<answer>Based on the search results, <cite id="S23">the first Harry Potter movie was released on November 16, 2001.</cite>Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{November 16, 2001}.</answer>

## WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

Below is a simple example that demonstrates the process and the correct use of tools and tags. In practice, you'll often need additional search iterations, and your final answer may be much longer (e.g., a multi-paragraph report).

Question: Give a concise update on 2024 renewable energy market trends and current commercial solar efficiency benchmarks.

<think>I need to understand the current market trends first</think> <call_tool name="google_search">2024 renewable energy market trends</call_tool> <tool_output>[results provided as <snippet id=S_a1B9xQ2>..</snippet>, <snippet id=S_pOZr41Q>..</snippet>]</tool_output>

with a local Qwen3-8B server. For ASearcher, we use their official codebase<sup>14</sup> to generate trajectories for all tasks. For WebThinker (Li et al., 2025a), we used their code base<sup>15</sup> and evaluated both their default mode as well as report mode.

Closed deep research systems. Figure 22 shows the prompt used to run the GPT-5 + Search and Gemini3 Pro + Search baseline. For Gemini3 Pro, we use Google Search and URL Content tools provided by Gemini API.

Naive RAG. For the Naive RAG baselines, we retrieve the top 10 search snippets from google_search using the original question, and then prompt the LM with a simple instruction: "Can you try to answer the question given the retrieved documents? Specifically, you should reason step by step given the evidence retrieved from the web; when there is no evidence present, you should try to answer it based on your knowledge. Please provide a final answer in the format of "Final Answer: [your answer here]".

Fixed pipeline deep research models on short-form questions. We do not evaluate models that use a specialized inference pipeline on short-form questions because they are unable to follow instructions to only output the answer.

Query: Which two scientists (first and last names) are credited with first isolating Azotobacter salinestris from saline soils? Answer in less than 10 words. Answer: Page and Shivprasad were the scientists who first isolated Azotobacter salinestris from saline soils <Paper corpusId="7646032"paperTitle="Robson et al., 2015)" isShortName></Paper>. While Beijerinck isolated Azotobacter species in 1901, this was a different species and predated the discovery of A. salinestris <Paper corpusId="87342753"paperTitle="(Shin et al., 2016)" isShortName></Paper>

# E.3 Score Calculation Details

Asta-ScholarQA-CS2. We use the official code<sup>16</sup> to evaluate our method and the baselines on Asta-ScholarQA-CS2. We compute rubric score, answer precision, citation precision and citation recall on the 100 test set questions using gemini-2.5-flash as the judge as detailed in Bragg et al. (2025). Asta-ScholarQA-CS2 requires evidence text from citations in order to judge citation precision and recall. For proprietary models (OpenAI Deep Research, GPT-5) that only provide URLs for citations, we use JINA API to scrape the URL and use the resulting text as citation evidence.

HealthBench. We use an adapted version of the OpenAI simple-evals suite<sup>17</sup> for the evaluation. For each multi-turn example, we concatenate the full conversation into a single input and prepend an instruction directing the model to answer the question based on this doctorpatient conversation. For efficiency, we randomly sample a subset of 1000 cases for evaluation.

DeepResearchBench. We use the official code<sup>18</sup> to evaluate our method and the baselines on DeepResearch-Bench. We compute the Comprehensiveness, Insight/Depth, Instruction-Following, and Readability of articles answering 50 English and 50 Chinese open-ended deep research questions. We report the Overall as the macro average of the component metrics. We use gemini-2.5-flash as the judge and Jina API to scrape the URL to acquire the evidence snippets when needed, as detailed in Du et al. (2025). For outputs from our system, we use the scraped URL content from the corresponding search or browsing tools.

ResearchQA. We evaluate our method and baselines using the original ResearchQA evaluation suite<sup>19</sup>. We compute the averaged rubric scores with GPT-4.1-mini as the judge on the 776 official subset of questions used to evaluate deep research systems, following Yifei et al. (2025).

# E.4 Details of Pathogenic Gene Variants Evaluation

Dataset The evaluation data for this task was derived from expert-curated information collected for 24 pathogenic gene variants published in the supplementary data of Cheerie et al. (2025), which was used to develop guidelines for the assessment of variant eligibility for various types of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gene therapy. Curations were done by members of the N=1 Collaborative Patient Identification Working Group, which consists of both medical professionals (MD, PhD, and master's level) and faculty with expertise in medical genetics. The selected variants were deemed feasible to assess with publicly available information, and each response was agreed upon by two members. This data reports characteristics of selected variants that are essential to determining therapeutic eligibility, including the variant's pathomechanism, haploinsufficiency status of the gene it affects, inheritance pattern of associated diseases, splicing effects, and findings from prior therapeutic approaches explored. We manually reformatted this data into 47 question-answer examples. Genetic variants are specified in HGVS notation. Questions were preceded with a few sentences of context containing some details on what types of evidence are preferred and proper answer format.

Setup To avoid the effects of contamination, we blocked all search results pointing to the paper and its supplementary files when evaluating models with our search tools. This was not possible for closed source DR systems, though the original paper did not appear in the output citations for any model. We also add the statement: "You should try to find multiple pieces of evidence to support any claims you make, and acknowledge conflicting/supporting evidence among sources searched" to the baseline prompt in Figure 22 for GPT+5, OpenAI DR, and Gemini 3 Pro to ensure they are calibrated to the preferences of this task

Evaluation Criteria Given that the task's ultimate goal is to aid medical decision-making, we designed criteria that capture not only the correctness of the final answer, but the usefulness of the generated report to a clinician or researcher:

- Final Answer indicates whether the expert-annotated fact was mentioned in the response. Each question has 1-3 key facts that should be present in an ideal response, and the per-example correctness is the average of these.  
- Evidence Quality indicates if the type of evidence requested in the query is present within the cited statements (e.g. functional assays in patient-derived cells). This score aims to penalize (1) uncited evidence and (2) evidence that is cited, but irrelevant. To demonstrate this, we provide an example response from DR Tulu that met the Evidence Synthesis criteria (Figure 23).  
- Evidence Support measures the proportion of cited statements in the response that are consistent with the original source text retrieved. This was calculated by evaluating each cited span with the original content of the cited source.  
- Evidence Synthesis indicates whether or not there was at least one statement describing the relationship between multiple sources, e.g. how papers might build off each other or conflict.

Similar to our prior experiments, we defined specific LLM judge instructions for each evaluation criteria per question and used GPT-4.1 to score each response. No additional training was performed for this task.

# F More Results and Analysis

# F.1 Full RL Training Curves

We show the reward, number of tool calls, and output sequence length through training in Figure 27. We observe that there appear to be two phases of training: in the first phase, sequence lengths and the average number of tool calls drop, and then they increase. Similar to prior work, we hypothesise this may be due to the model initially unlearning unsuccessful behaviors picked up during SFT training before stabilizing and exploring new strategies. A similar drop-and-rise behaviour when combining RL training with SFT cold-start data has been observed in other domains such as mathematical reasoning (Chen et al., 2025a), and we leave further investigation of this phenomenon to future work.

Surprisingly, we also find that our training is somewhat robust to tool errors, as we accidentally ran out of serper credits during training. While we eventually refilled, the model did train for some number of steps wherein serper would continuously return errors, as seen by the drop in reward and sequence length. However, despite this, our overall model performance continued to improve, with step 1900 being significantly better than step 1000 (right before the serper credit issue). This suggests our training is somewhat robust to server-side tool errors, and exploring the degree of this robustness is an interesting avenue for future investigation.

# F.2 Cost Estimation

In this section, we detail how we estimate the cost of deep research models. For proprietary models, we use the actual billed costs reported in their API consoles. Although Gemini 3 + Search waivers the first 1,500 searches per day,[20] we still include search costs in our estimates for a fair comparison with other systems that charge for search.

For open models (including our own), we compute the number of input and output tokens and use OpenRouter's published pricing to estimate inference costs. Specifically, we use the published pricing for Tongyi Deep Research $^{21}$ ; we use the published pricing for Qwen3-8B for DR Tulu, WebExplorer-8B, ASearcher $^{22}$ ; We use the published pricing for QwQ-32B for WebThinker models $^{23}$ . We treat system prompts and questions as input tokens, and all remaining tokens as output tokens in our calculations for open models. We also add tool-call costs based on the pricing of each tool's API provider and the average number of tool calls performed by each model across our long-form evaluations.

# Example Response of DR Tulu-8B on GeneticDiseasesQA Part I

# USER:

Context: Your task is to determine the pathomechanism of a given pathogenic gene variant. A pathogenic variant can lead to different effects. The variant can lead to a loss of function (LoF) of a protein, a toxic gain of function (GoF), or a dominant-negative (DN) effect. Assessing the variant effect can be done by retrieving publications and reports of the variant [...]

Question: What is the pathomechanism of variant NM_001127222.2(CACNA1A):c.4174G>A?

# Summary of the variant and its identity

- The variant NM_001127222.2(CACNA1A):c.4174G>A corresponds to a missense change p.Val1392Met in the CACNA1A alpha 1A subunit and is curated as a pathogenic or likely pathogenic allele in clinical resources, notably ClinVar and the ClinGen allele registry, where it is associated with familial hemiplegic migraine and related neurologic phenotypes <cite id="00907dd4-0">NM_001127222.2(CACNA1A):c.4174G>A (p.Val1392Met) is cataloged as a single-nucleotide variant in ClinVar with the canonical transcript NM_001127222.2</cite>
<cite id="00907dd4-4">The ClinGen Allele Registry lists NM_001127222.2(CACNA1A):c.4174G>A (p.Val1392Met) as a registered canonical allele</cite>
<cite id="00907dd4-6">MGeND maps NM_001127222.2(CACNA1A):c.4174G>A (p.Val1392Met) to Migraine, familial hemiplegic, 1 (FHM1)</cite>.

Gene-level context: CACNA1A encodes the P/Q-type calcium channel alpha 1A subunit and underlies an autosomal dominant channelopathy spectrum

- CACNA1A encodes the pore-forming \(\mathbb{S}\backslash \mathrm{alpha}\mathbb{S}1\mathbb{A}\) subunit of the high-voltage-activated P/Q-type calcium channel and is a dominant disease gene for three disorders: familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) <cite id="00907dd4-1">Pathogenic variants in CACNA1A are associated with episodic ataxia type 2, familial hemiplegic migraine, and spinocerebellar ataxia \(6</text> <cite id="8169b531-9">The CACNA1A gene was identified for FHM; it encodes the \(\mathbb{S}\backslash \mathrm{alpha}\mathbb{S}1\mathbb{A}\) subunit of the P/Q-type calcium channel</cite>.

- Clinically, affected individuals present on a phenotypic spectrum from migraine with transient hemiplegia/ataxia to persistent cerebellar ataxia and atrophy, consistent with dominant inheritance and variable expressivity <cite id="7a079b1d-9">Mutations in CACNA1A are responsible for at least three autosomal dominant disorders: FHM1, episodic ataxia, and spinocerebellar ataxia</cite> <cite id="7a079b1d-0">CACNA1A-related hemiplegic migraine is associated with neurological variability and requires urgent treatment</cite> <cite id="7a079b1d-7">Clinically, CACNA1A variants are linked to autosomal dominant FHM with cerebellar ataxia</cite>.

- Across conditions, both gain-of-function (GoF) and loss-of-function (LoF)/haploinsufficient phenotypes have been described, with FHM commonly linked to GoF variants affecting channel gating/hyperexcitability and ataxia/SCA6 more often associated with LoF/hypofunction or channel dysfunction leading to neurodegeneration <cite id="8169b531-7">Hemiplegic migraines are associated with particular types of genetic changes in CACNA1A called "gain of function" variants</cite> <cite id="7a079b1d-6">FHM with cerebellar ataxia is only associated with specific CACNA1A mutations that lead to ataxia</cite>.

- In broader neurodevelopmental disease, CACNA1A variants have also been reported in epileptic encephalopathy and cognitive/autism phenotypes, underscoring that some pathogenic variants may act through haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative effects in certain contexts <cite id="00907dd4-2">ClinVar Miner notes CACNA1A missense variants in neurodevelopmental conditions</cite> <cite id="00907dd4-5">Reports associate CACNA1A haploinsufficiency with cognitive impairment, autism, and epileptic encephalopathy with mild cerebellar symptoms</cite>.

Variant-specific evidence and phenotype triangulation for p.Val1392Met (c.4174G>A)

- The p.Val1392Met change in CACNA1A is curated as pathogenic/likely pathogenic for FHM and, in some families, associated with persistent cerebellar ataxia and atrophy, aligning with a dominant gain-of-toxic-function mechanism that perturbs neuronal excitability (migraine) and, in some cases, contributes to neurodegeneration <cite id="00907dd4-0">ClinVar classifies NM_001127222.2(CACNA1A):c.4174G>A (p.Val1392Met)</cite> <cite id="7a079b1d-9">FHM and ataxia phenotypes are both linked to CACNA1A mutations in an autosomal dominant framework</cite>
<cite id="7a079b1d-6">FHM with cerebellar ataxia is only associated with certain CACNA1A mutations</cite>.

- Population and registry compilations include c.4174G>A among pathogenic CACNA1A variants, reinforcing its role in the dominant channelopathy spectrum; however, direct electrophysiological characterization of this specific variant (e.g., activation voltage, Ca2+ influx, inactivation) is not provided in the retrieved summaries and would require targeted functional assays <cite id="00907dd4-9">Variant catalogs list NM_001127222.2(CACNA1A):c.4174G>A (p.Val1392Met) among pathogenic CACNA1A variants</cite>
<cite id="8169b531-8">Clinical-genetic characterization of CACNA1A-related disease summarizes dominant phenotypes across FHM, EA2, and SCA6</cite>.

Applying the criteria to determine pathomechanism

- Dominant inheritance and autosomal transmission across FHM, EA2, and SCA6 support a dominant mechanism at the gene-phenotype level for CACNA1A variants <cite id="7a079b1d-9">CACNA1A-related disorders are autosomal dominant</cite>.

- For pathomechanism, CACNA1A variants can act as GoF (hyperexcitability/channel dysfunction causing migraine) or LoF/haploinsufficient (reduced channel function leading to ataxia/degeneration), with some variants producing mixed or variable phenotypes depending on domain impact and genetic background <cite id="8169b531-7">FHM is associated with gain-of-function variants in CACNA1A</cite> <cite id="7a079b1d-6">FHM with cerebellar ataxia is specifically associated with certain CACNA1A mutations that lead to ataxia</cite> <cite id="00907dd4-5">Haploinsufficiency in CACNA1A has been linked to neurodevelopmental phenotypes</cite>.

- When both GoF and LoF mechanisms are plausible at the gene level, the variant's phenotype and inheritance refine the likely mechanism. In FHM, transient neurologic deficits and aura point to a dominant gain-of-toxic-function mechanism in sensory-motor cortical circuits; in EA2/SCA6, persistent ataxia and cerebellar atrophy point to reduced channel function or progressive neurodegeneration, consistent with LoF/haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative effects in cerebellar pathways <cite id="8169b531-7">Hemiplegic migraine variants are labeled as gain-of-function</cite> <cite id="7a079b1d-6">Cerebellar ataxia in FHM is linked to specific CACNA1A mutations</cite>.

- Given that p.Val1392Met is cataloged as pathogenic for FHM and associated with cerebellar ataxia/atrophy in some pedigrees, the most parsimonious pathomechanism is a dominant gain-of-toxic-function effect on neuronal excitability that drives migraine, with possible additional contributions to cerebellar dysfunction via haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative effects in cerebellar circuits, depending on genetic background and penetrance <cite id="00907dd4-0">ClinVar catalogs p.Val1392Met as a pathogenic CACNA1A variant</cite> <cite id="7a079b1d-9">Autosomal dominant inheritance and variable phenotypes across FHM, EA2, and SCA6 are established</cite> <cite id="00907dd4-5">Haploinsufficiency in CACNA1A contributes to neurodevelopmental disease</cite>.

# Uncertainties and what functional studies would resolve them

- The retrieved evidence establishes the variant's identity, clinical classification, and the gene's dominant channelopathy framework, but does not provide direct patch-clamp or Ca2+ imaging data for p.Val1392Met. Therefore, while a dominant gain-of-toxic-function mechanism is most consistent with FHM presentation and gene-level GoF associations, we cannot exclude a dominant-negative or partial haploinsufficient contribution without direct tests <cite id="8169b531-8">Clinical and genetic characterization supports dominant mechanisms but lacks variant-specific electrophysiology</cite>.

- To conclusively classify the mechanism for c.4174G>A (p.Val1392Met), the following functional evidence would be decisive:

- Heterologous expression studies in HEK293 or Xenopus oocytes measuring Ca2+ current amplitude, activation/dactivation kinetics, voltage dependence, inactivation, and pharmacology, with rescue by wild-type co-expression to test for dominant-negative effects <cite id="00907dd4-9">Variant catalogs emphasize the need for functional characterization for CACNA1A missense variants</cite>.

- Neuronal action potential and neurotransmitter release assays in cerebellar Purkinje cells or cortical neurons to quantify excitability changes and test for GoF vs LoF phenotypes <cite id="8169b531-9">CACNA1A encodes the P/Q-type channel critical for neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability</cite>.

- Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons or patient-specific cerebellar organoids to assess developmental  $\mathrm{Ca2+}$  signaling and degeneration kinetics in LoF vs GoF contexts <cite id="00907dd4-5">Reports link CACNA1A haploinsufficiency to neurodevelopmental phenotypes, supporting developmental functional assays</cite>.

- Trans-heterozygosity testing in models (e.g., LoF knockouts) to probe dominant-negative interactions specific to p.Val1392Met <cite id="7a079b1d-6">FHM with cerebellar ataxia is associated with specific CACNA1A mutations suggesting gene-dose interactions</cite>.

# Final assessment for NM_001127222.2(CACNA1A):c.4174G>A (p.Val1392Met)

- Pathomechanism: Dominant gain-of-toxic-function in the neuronal excitability pathway is the most consistent explanation for p.Val1392Met, given its classification as a pathogenic FHM variant and the gene's GoF-linked channelopathy basis for migraine; in some pedigrees with cerebellar ataxia/atrophy, additional haploinsufficient or dominant-negative contributions in cerebellar pathways may contribute, yielding a mixed mechanism across brain regions and genetic backgrounds <cite id="00907dd4-0">ClinVar classifies p.Val1392Met as pathogenic in CACNA1A</cite> <cite id="8169b531-7">FHM is associated with gain-of-function CACNA1A variants</cite> <cite id="7a079b1d-6">Cerebellar ataxia in FHM is associated with specific CACNA1A mutations, suggesting multi-domain effects</cite> <cite id="00907dd4-5">Haploinsufficiency in CACNA1A is linked to neurodevelopmental phenotypes</cite>.

- Practical implication: In clinical contexts where CACNA1A pathogenic variants are known to act dominantly and cause FHM with possible cerebellar involvement, c.4174G>A (p.Val1392Met) should be considered to confer a dominant gain-of-function (toxic) effect on P/Q-type Ca2+ channel-mediated neurotransmission, with possible additive/penetrant haploinsufficient effects in cerebellar pathways in affected families <cite id="7a079b1d-9">Autosomal dominant inheritance and variable phenotypes across migraine and ataxia are established for CACNA1A</cite> <cite id="8169b531-7">Gain-of-function mechanism is characteristic of FHM-associated CACNA1A variants</cite>.

Evidence gaps and recommendations
- Direct functional characterization of p.Val1392Met remains to be reported in the retrieved literature; thus, further mechanistic studies (as outlined above) are warranted to exclude or confirm dominant-negative or LoF contributions and to delineate the variant's phenotype-mechanism continuum within the CACNA1A spectrum of disease <cite id="8169b531-8">Clinical-genetic summaries highlight the need for functional follow-up of CACNA1A missense variants</cite> <cite id="00907dd4-9">Variant catalogs emphasize the presence of pathogenic missense variants across neurological conditions and the need for functional characterization</cite>.

# F.3 Effect of the tool-call budget at inference time.

We studied how the inference-time tool-call budget affects performance by varying the maximum number of allowed tool calls to  $\{1,3,5,10,15\}$ . For both SFT and RL models, performance typically saturates around a budget of five tool calls, although RL occasionally improves with an additional budget of up to ten tool calls; see Figure 28. This matches tool call behavior seen during RL training (Appendix F.1), in which the model uses 3-4 tool calls on average per sample.

# F.4 Evaluation Variances

The inference and evaluation of deep research models often exhibit significant variance. When running models on the same questions or evaluating them on the same benchmarks, the results can vary substantially. Typically, there are three key factors that contribute to this variance and we will discuss them in the following sections.

# F.4.1 Variances Introduced by Tools

Invoking a tool with identical inputs at different times can yield inconsistent outputs, leading the model to produce divergent subsequent contexts. In this section, we focus on the output variance introduced by the search engine.

We sampled 100 function-calling queries and reissued these queries to the serper google search, with approximately one week between the two invocations. We then computed the differences in the top-1, top-3, top-5, and top-10 retrieved snippets for each pair of calls. For comparison, we also measured the differences between two calls issued nearly the same time. We use the following metrics to evaluate the variance of search engine's returns.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Metric</td><td colspan="4">Top-K Snippets</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>set_same</td><td>0.77</td><td>2.04</td><td>3.34</td><td>6.01</td></tr><tr><td>pos_MATCH</td><td>0.77</td><td>1.71</td><td>2.22</td><td>2.93</td></tr></table>

(a) One-week apart  

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Metric</td><td colspan="4">Top-K Snippets</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>set_same</td><td>0.88</td><td>2.53</td><td>4.20</td><td>7.67</td></tr><tr><td>pos_MATCH</td><td>0.88</td><td>2.35</td><td>3.48</td><td>5.64</td></tr></table>

- set_same: The number of shared items within the top- $k$  results, regardless of order (i.e., the size of the intersection).  
- pos_MATCH: The number of positions in the top- $k$  where both lists contain the same item at the same rank.

As shown in Table 12, the search engine's returns are unstable. Even when calling the same query within a short interval, it still produces noticeably different results. The average overlap in the top-10 snippets is only about 7.67, with exact rank matches dropping to 5.64. When the same queries are reissued one week apart, the search engine's returns diverge more significantly. We show examples of inconsistencies in Figure 29.

# F.4.2 Variances Introduced by Inference

Generating particularly long trajectories can also introduce variance. Small differences early in the process can lead to substantially divergent final responses. To observe the impact of this variability, we re-ran one short-form benchmark and two long-form benchmarks, comparing the outputs from two separate generations using GPT-4.1 with our auto-search pipeline.

As shown in Table 13, in 2Wiki, GPT-4.1 produces final answers that differ by  $29.3\%$  in the 300 cases and obtains high variances in long-form tasks like Healthbench and ResearchQA as well.

(b) Within a short interval  
Table 12 Search engine output variance across repeated queries. The left table shows results when two queries were issued one week apart, while the right table shows results when the two queries were issued within a short interval.  

<table><tr><td>Task</td><td>2Wiki</td><td>Healthbench</td><td>ResearchQA</td></tr><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>300</td><td>900</td><td>776</td></tr><tr><td>Diff</td><td>29.3</td><td>17.1</td><td>9.81</td></tr></table>

# F.4.3 Variances Introduced by Judge Models

When evaluating the same responses in different times, even if using the same model as a judge, inconsistent judgments may occur.

We use GPT-4.1 to evaluate the same trajectories twice and the results are shown in Table 14. The judgments show relatively high consistency and reliability on both short-form and long-form tasks.

Table 13 Inference Variance. The Diff in 2Wiki refers to the difference in two final answers of the two trajectories under the same cases, while the Diff in Healthbench and ResearchQA represents the absolute difference in LLM judged scores.

# F.5 Mismatch between RL Training and Downstream Evaluation

During development of DR Tulu, we found that our RL training setup had some mismatch with our downstream performance: models that achieved the highest training reward did not necessarily achieve the highest downstream evaluation performance. To highlight this, compare the training reward of the "No SFT" and "Our SFT" models in Figure 30 against their performance in Figure 7. While starting directly from Qwen 3 ("No SFT") achieves highest train reward, it has dramatically lower downstream evaluation results (see Figure 7). It also displays significantly different behavior, using significantly more tool calls than the cold-started ("Our SFT") model.

This may be due to a few factors: first, our evaluations use rubrics generated in different manners to our own training rubrics (e.g., Healthbench uses expert-annotated rubrics), potentially leading to cases where test-time rubrics evaluate features not commonly tested in our training rubrics. Second, there may be reward hacking behavior during RL training, due to our use of an LM judge different to the judges used in downstream evaluation. Our in-loop judge model uses GPT-4.1-mini, while downstream evaluations use varied different models (e.g., SQAv2 uses Gemini Flash 2.5, DRB uses a mix of Gemini Pro 2.5 and Gemini Flash 2.5, and Healthbench uses GPT-4.1, all with varying prompts and evaluation harnesses). This may lead to our RL training optimizing for attributes preferred by GPT-4.1-mini, but not by downstream evaluation judges. We finally conjecture that another contributing factor may be the difference in model priors: different models may exploit rewards in different ways. For example, rollouts from a weaker model may contain fewer high-quality answers; when all answers are poor, the judge model may end up selecting based solely on spurious features rather than making meaningful quality comparisons. In contrast, when starting from the same initial model, we usually observe that reward improvements correlate well with downstream scores. We defer a deeper investigation of this mismatch phenomenon to future work, as addressing it would help improve the effectiveness of rubrics for RL training.

Decompose the question: We need to (a) outline foundational learning theories (behaviorism, constructivism, connectivism) and explicitly connect them to AI-in-education designs, and (b) explain prominent AI models/frameworks (ITS, adaptive learning, learning analytics, NLP in education), including features, applications, and contributions (personalization, teacher efficiency, engagement), all supported by recent scholarly sources.

Assumptions: There are review/survey papers in AI in Education (AIED), Learning Analytics (LAK), and Educational Data Mining (EDM) from 2020-2025 that synthesize how pedagogical theories inform AI tools, and evaluations of ITS, adaptive systems, analytics, and NLP tools. We should also pull specific examples and quantified impacts where possible (e.g., learning gains from ITS, prediction performance in LA, efficacy of automated feedback).

# Search plan:

1) Start with surveys/reviews linking AI in education to learning theories (2020-2025), ideally in AIED, BJET, Computers \& Education, Review of Educational Research, LAK, EDM venues.  
2) Retrieve authoritative sources on ITS and adaptive learning (classic + recent advances like knowledge tracing, deep KT, mastery learning, LLM tutoring).  
3) Gather learning analytics frameworks and applications (early warning systems, dashboards, ethics).  
4) Collect NLP-in-education applications (automated scoring, feedback, dialogue tutoring, LLMs) and evidence on teacher efficiency and student engagement.

First query will target a broad review tying theories and AI models together.

Reflection on first query results:

- The initial search returned broad reviews touching on AI branches (ML, DL, NLP) and applications (ITS, adaptive learning, automated assessment) with some claims about personalization and teacher support (S_c8C9s9m, S_NTanrK5, S_N8QWms7). These are relevant but high-level and light on explicit connections to learning theories and quantitative evidence.

- S_tuhIPDv explicitly mentions ITS and NLP integrating behaviorism, constructivism, and connectivism, which is directly pertinent, though I need stronger, peer-reviewed sources that articulate these theory-to-tool mappings.

- For models/frameworks, I also need authoritative, recent evidence on ITS effectiveness, adaptive learning via knowledge tracing, learning analytics frameworks (predictive models, dashboards), and NLP applications (AWE, ASR, chatbots, LLMs) with impacts on personalization, teacher efficiency, and engagement.

Gaps:

- Explicit theoretical grounding linking behaviorism, constructivism, and connectivism to AI tools with scholarly backing.  
- Quantitative or meta-analytic evidence for ITS/adaptive systems.  
- Up-to-date learning analytics frameworks and outcomes  
- NLP in education evidence, including automated feedback and LLM-based tutoring.

We have initial broad reviews but need stronger, specific evidence tying learning theories to AI designs and quantifying effects for ITS, adaptive learning, learning analytics, and NLP in education. Key gaps: (1) explicit mapping of behaviorism/constructivism/connectivism to AI paradigms with scholarly backing; (2) quantitative evidence for ITS/adaptive learning (e.g., learning gains, knowledge tracing); (3) learning analytics frameworks and teacher-facing outcomes; and (4) NLP applications (AWE/ASR/chatbots/LLM tutors) with impacts on personalization, efficiency, and engagement.

We have gathered broad reviews on AI in education and some mentions connecting pedagogical theories to AI paradigms. We also have meta-analytic evidence for ITS effectiveness summarized in recent reviews, but we still need: (a) clearer, recent sources on adaptive learning mechanisms like knowledge tracing; (b) specific learning analytics frameworks and teacher-facing applications; and (c) NLP-in-education evidence including automated feedback and LLM-based tutoring impacts. We have performed four searches; we can do up to four more if needed. However, current snippets include: a systematic review describing AI branches and applications in education (S_c8C9s9m); papers situating AI paradigms within behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist frames (S_YRwbcNE, S_JCPVjqk, S_6KKZmn3); reviews summarizing ITS/adaptivity and meta-analyses with effect sizes (S_lUcsvG5, S_sUEgQk4, S_xkpGPkk); and reviews of NLP applications in language learning (S_KVwSGwG) and integrated AI+learning analytics perspectives (S_RBEFb7h). While we could add more targeted evidence on knowledge tracing and dashboards, the current evidence suffices to construct a theory-to-tool mapping and to detail features/applications and contributions across ITS, adaptive learning, learning analytics, and NLP with citations. I will structure the answer with sections: (1) Foundations: behaviorism, constructivism, connectivism and their implications for AI tools; (2) Intelligent Tutoring Systems; (3) Adaptive Learning Systems; (4) Learning Analytics; (5) NLP in Education; (6) Contributions to personalized learning, teacher efficiency, and engagement; (7) Emerging trends and considerations.

Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education encompasses techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing that analyze learner data to personalize instruction, generate feedback, and support pedagogical decision-making across intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive platforms, and learning analytics tools <cite id="S_c8C9s9m">AI has many branches and sub-branches, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing; in education, AI supports intelligent tutoring systems, intelligent agents, and intelligent collaborative learning systems, and supports teachers' decision making by reporting real-time class statuses and personalized learning platforms</cite>. Recent syntheses emphasize AI's rapid expansion into personalized feedback, chatbots, and virtual environments for engagement and co-creation, while underscoring the need for interdisciplinary integration with learning sciences <cite id="S_4yWBOUY">AI in education has evolved from computer-assisted instruction to intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning technologies, with key themes including personalized feedback, natural language processing, and innovative tools like chatbots and virtual reality, enhancing student engagement and facilitating knowledge co-creation</cite><cite id="S_RBEFb7h">The integration of AI, particularly through learning analytics and NLP, is revolutionizing education by enhancing personalized learning experiences and engagement, with advancements like large language models improving performance in examinations and emphasizing collaboration between AI developers and educators</cite>.

Foundational Theories and How They Inform AI in Education

Behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism offer complementary lenses for designing AI-enabled learning experiences. Behaviorism emphasizes observable behavior change through stimuli, repetition, and reinforcement, aligning with drill-and-practice, mastery learning, and immediate feedback mechanisms common in early computer-assisted instruction and some ITS components <cite id="S_6KKZmn3">The earliest learning theory, behaviorism, focuses on human behaviors based on repetition and response to stimuli, enabling learning to be observed and quantified</cite>. Constructivism positions learners as active constructors of knowledge through authentic, collaborative, and reflective activity, motivating AI tools that scaffold inquiry, support problem-based learning, and adaptively guide students through complex tasks <cite id="S_6KKZmn3">Constructivism is learner-centered, emphasizing collaborative, active, and reflective learning where students act autonomously and self-directed</cite><cite id="S_XrZdksg">Constructivism encompasses situated cognition, activity theory, experiential learning, anchored instruction, and authentic learning as frameworks for educational technology, organized under a constructivist umbrella</cite>.

How do the narrow and broad approaches to CSR reporting differ in terms of their scope and the stakeholders they address?

# Assistant

# <think>

Decompose the question: We need to define and differentiate the "narrow" versus "broad" approaches to CSR reporting, specifically along two dimensions: (1) scope (what is reported) and (2) stakeholders addressed (who benefits/engages with the report). Assumptions: This terminology is used in CSR/ sustainability reporting frameworks and literature (e.g., AA1000AS, GRI, SASB, integrated reporting). Plan:

1) Search for authoritative definitions of "narrow" vs "broad" stakeholder engagement in CSR.  
2) Find sources that explicitly define "narrow scope" CSR (e.g., compliance-only, triple bottom line metrics) vs "broad scope" (stakeholder dialogue, materiality, governance, long-term value).  
3) Retrieve evidence on who the reports address (shareholders vs a wider stakeholder community), including practitioner frameworks (e.g., AA1000AS stakeholder engagement principle).  
4) Cross-check with standards like GRI (comprehensive, wide stakeholder audience) and SASB (focused, investor-material), to map scope vs audience.

<think>Goal: Define and differentiate "narrow" vs "broad" approaches to CSR reporting by (a) scope of what is reported and (b) stakeholders addressed. Strategy:

1) Find authoritative definitions and contrasts (preferably from academic papers and reputable frameworks).  
2) Use the first Google search results to identify key sources, then browse pages for precise language on scope and audience.  
3) Corroborate with recognized reporting frameworks (AA1000AS stakeholder engagement principle; GRI vs SASB scope differences).  
4) Ensure at least four searches: initial Google search done; next, targeted searches for AA1000AS, GRI/SASB comparison, and a paper explicitly discussing narrow vs broad CSR reporting scope.

Reflection on first search:

- PMC article (S_d7607bb2-0) mentions that approach choice depends on intended scope and target audience-relevant framing.  
- Sustainability Management Wiki (S_d7607bb2-3) claims narrow vs broad scope/target group-potentially useful but I need more authoritative backing.  
- Harvard Law corporate governance post (S_d7607bb2-5) discusses CSR report informing stakeholders about addressing their concerns-useful for audience/stakeholder dialogue.  
- NBER working paper (S_d7607bb2-6) gives an operational definition of narrowing scope to securities-law-required info-useful for narrow scope exemplar.

# <think>

Plan: We need authoritative definitions and contrasts of "narrow" versus "broad" CSR reporting, specifically along (1) reporting scope and (2) stakeholders addressed. I will: - Use the initial Google results to identify key academic framing (scope and audience). - Add AA1000AS to ground a "broad" approach via stakeholder engagement and materiality. - Use GRI vs SASB comparisons to concretely illustrate broad (comprehensive, multi-stakeholder) versus narrow (focused, investor-material) scope and audiences. I have already run three searches and have relevant snippets: a peer-reviewed article not that approach choice depends on intended scope and target audience; examples of narrowing scope to legally required information; and multiple GRI-SASB sources indicating GRI's bro scope and audience versus SASB's focused/investor materiality. I will synthesize these, noting where evidence is explicit (scope and audience differences) and where it is inferential (mapping "broad" to AA1000AS stakeholder engagement/materiality). I will then produce a structured answer with citations on each claim.

Remaining gaps: A direct paper explicitly defining "narrow" vs "broad" CSR reporting terms would be ideal, but the PMC article and other sources suffice to explain the distinction in scope and audience. I will proceed to synthesize.

# Structure for answer:

- Definitions and framing: what "narrow" vs "broad" mean in scope and audience.  
- Scope differences: compliance/required info vs comprehensive material issues.  
- Stakeholders addressed: narrow (selected investors/regulators/creditors) vs broad (all materially affected stakeholders including communities, customers, employees, suppliers, NGOs).  
- Standards mapping: AA1000AS (stakeholder engagement/materiality), GRI (broad), SASB (narrow/investor materiality) as illustrative examples.

# </think>

# <answer>

# Short answer

- Scope: A narrow CSR reporting approach confines disclosure to a limited set of issues, often legally required or compliance-oriented; a broad approach covers a wider set of material issues identified through stakeholder engagement across economic, environmental, and social dimensions. <cite id="d7607bb2-6">One way to narrow the scope of CSR reporting is to confine it to information required by securities law.</cite> <cite id="4a55f4d8-4">GRI requires identifying material topics to establish the scope and included issues covered by a company's report.</cite> <cite id="59a6bf6a-2">AA1000's principles of inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness require a defined process of stakeholder engagement to determine what to report.</cite>  
- Stakeholders addressed: A narrow approach targets a limited audience (e.g., investors, regulators, or specific creditors) and signals compliance; a broad approach addresses a wider community of stakeholders (including employees, communities, customers, suppliers, NGOs) through dialogue and reporting on issues that materially affect them. <cite id="d7607bb2-0">Whether one chooses a narrow or broad approach depends on normative views about the intended scope and target audience.</cite> <cite id="d7607bb2-5">CSR reports can inform stakeholders about how a company has addressed their concerns, reflecting stakeholder engagement.</cite> <cite id="4a55f4d8-1">GRI has a larger scope and broader audience, while SASB enables deeper, sector-specific information for a more focused audience.</cite>

What "narrow" CSR reporting entails

Figure 37 Example trajectory of DR Tulu on ResearchQA Part III.

# Assistant (Final Answer)

- Reporting scope: Restricted to a small set of issues, typically where regulation or minimal standards dictate disclosure; this constrains the breadth of topics and the depth of information. <cite id="d7607bb2-6">Confining CSR reporting to information required under securities laws is a concrete way to narrow scope.</cite>  
- Stakeholders addressed: Primarily those with formal information rights or enforcement powers (e.g., investors, regulators, creditors) rather than a broad stakeholder community; the report often signals compliance rather than engaging a wider set of interest groups. <cite id="d7607bb2-0">Choice of a narrow approach is linked to a narrower target audience.</cite> <cite id="d7607bb2-5">A narrow CSR report addresses concerns raised by a more limited set of stakeholders compared to a broad report.</cite>

What "broad" CSR reporting entails

- Reporting scope: Comprehensive coverage of material issues determined through inclusive stakeholder engagement and materiality assessments across environmental, social, and governance domains; this typically includes balanced, context-sensitive issues with depth where material. <cite id="59a6bf6a-2">Materiality and inclusivity require a defined stakeholder engagement process to guide what is included.</cite> <cite id="4a55f4d8-4">Materiality is used to establish the report's scope and included issues.</cite> <cite id="4a55f4d8-6">GRI Standards are designed to be used by organizations in any sector, implying broader coverage.</cite>  
- Stakeholders addressed: A wide range of stakeholders who can affect or are affected by the organization, including employees, communities, customers, suppliers, NGOs, and regulators, with reporting intended to inform and facilitate dialogue. <cite id="d7607bb2-0">A broad approach targets a broader audience.</cite> <cite id="d7607bb2-5">CSR reports in a broad approach inform stakeholders about how their concerns have been addressed, reflecting engagement.</cite> <cite id="4a55f4d8-2">GRI is designed to provide information to a broad audience, while SASB dives deeper for a more specific one.</cite>

How standards illustrate the difference

- AA1000AS (Accountability Principles): Embeds materiality in stakeholder engagement (principles of inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness), operationalizing a broad approach that defines scope through dialogue with those affected and allocating limited resources to material topics. <cite id="59a6bf6a-2">AA1000 emphasizes inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness via structured stakeholder engagement.</cite> <cite id="59a6bf6a-8">A material topic is one that will substantively influence assessments, decisions, actions, and performance of the organization and/or stakeholders.</cite>  
- GRI: Broad, global framework that covers a wide range of sustainability topics and guides scope via materiality assessments, addressing diverse stakeholder groups. <cite id="4a55f4d8-6">GRI Standards are sector-applicable and designed for broad use, covering a wide range of sustainability topics.</cite> <cite id="4a55f4d8-4">GRI requires identifying material topics to establish scope.</cite> <cite id="4a55f4d8-1">GRI's scope is larger and intended for a broader audience than SASB.</cite>  
- SASB: Narrower, investor-oriented framework that focuses on industry-specific, financially material issues, enabling deeper coverage for a focused audience (primarily investors). <cite id="4a55f4d8-1">SASB enables deeper, sector-specific information for a more focused audience than GRI.</cite> <cite id="4a55f4d8-8">SASB is focused on financially material ESG issues in specific industries, i.e., a narrower scope and audience.</cite>

It calls paper_search  $96.8\%$  of the time, google_search  $2.4\%$  of the time, and webBXse  $0.9\%$  of the time. S2 API is free to use. We estimate Serper search as USD 0.00075 per query and Jina browse as USD 0.00005 per query. As such, the average query costs USD 0.000079. Even if the model calls the most expensive API (Serper search) the maximum number of times allowed during evaluation (10 times), this gives a maximum cost of USD 0.0075 per query. 9https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-8b 
Page 13: Note that Evidence Support is computed using supporting snippets. For OpenAI and Gemini models that do not return snippets, we instead retrieve the full webpage content via Jina browsing using the provided URLs, which differs from how we compute Evidence Support for DR Tulu, Qwen3-8B, and Ai2 ScholarQA Agent. Nevertheless, all systems perform reasonably well on Evidence Support. 
Page 15: <sup>11</sup>We hypothesize the citation score drop is due to the presence of model calls not supported by our pipeline in the SFT data. These calls take the form of XML tags that the citation scorer picks up and penalizes (e.g. <Model name=Anthropic version=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219>). These comprised a small portion of our data, and as such are not picked up by smaller SFT subsets, but are picked up when training on the full dataset. We will further investigate this drop in future work.
