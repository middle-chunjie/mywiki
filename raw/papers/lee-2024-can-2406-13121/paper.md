###### Abstract

Long-context language models (LCLMs) have the potential to revolutionize our approach to tasks traditionally reliant on external tools like retrieval systems or databases.
Leveraging LCLMs’ ability to natively ingest and process entire corpora of information offers numerous advantages.
It enhances user-friendliness by eliminating the need for specialized knowledge of tools, provides robust end-to-end modeling that minimizes cascading errors in complex pipelines, and allows for the application of sophisticated prompting techniques across the entire system.
To assess this paradigm shift, we introduce LOFT, a benchmark of real-world tasks requiring context up to millions of tokens designed to evaluate LCLMs’ performance on in-context retrieval and reasoning.
Our findings reveal LCLMs’ surprising ability to rival state-of-the-art retrieval and RAG systems, despite never having been explicitly trained for these tasks.
However, LCLMs still face challenges in areas like compositional reasoning that are required in SQL-like tasks.
Notably, prompting strategies significantly influence performance, emphasizing the need for continued research as context lengths grow.
Overall, LOFT provides a rigorous testing ground for LCLMs, showcasing their potential to supplant existing paradigms and tackle novel tasks as model capabilities scale.111The LOFT benchmark is available at [https://github.com/google-deepmind/loft](https://github.com/google-deepmind/loft "").<img src='x1.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='821' height='489' />Figure 1: An overview of the LOFT benchmark, made of six tasks which measure LCLMs’ ability to do in-context retrieval, reasoning, and many-shot learning on corpora up to millions of tokens.
We compare the performance of LCLMs against specialized models (e.g., CLIP for visual retrieval), which often rely on complex task-specific fine-tuning or pipelining.
Unlike specialized models, we show how LCLMs can simplify various tasks through Corpus-in-Context Prompting ([Section 3]).

1 Introduction
--------------

Long-context language models (LCLMs)*[[9], [21], [45], [4], [52]]* hold the promise of reshaping artificial intelligence by enabling entirely new tasks and applications while eliminating the reliance on tools and complex pipelines previously necessary due to context length limitations*[[22], [34]]*.
By consolidating complex pipelines into a unified model, LCLMs ameliorate issues like cascading errors*[[8]]* and cumbersome optimization*[[30], [61]]*, offering a streamlined end-to-end approach to model development.
Moreover, techniques such as adding instructions *[[27], [59], [14]]*, incorporating few-shot examples*[[12]]*, and leveraging demonstrations via chain-of-thought prompting *[[44], [60]]* can be seamlessly integrated to optimize LCLMs for the task at hand.

However, realizing the full potential of LCLMs requires rigorous evaluation on truly long-context tasks useful in real-world applications.
Existing benchmarks fall short in this regard, relying on synthetic tasks like the popular “needle-in-haystack” *[[25], [32]]* or fixed-length datasets that fail to keep pace with the evolving definition of “long-context” *[[6]]*.
Critically, existing evaluations do not adequately stress-test LCLMs on any paradigm-shifting tasks.

To address this, we introduce the Long-Context Frontiers (LOFT) benchmark, a suite of six tasks consisting of 35 datasets which span text, visual, and audio modalities, to push LCLMs to their limits and gauge their real-world impact.
Unlike previous benchmarks, LOFT allows for automatic creation of increasing context lengths. While the current version extends to one million tokens, it can easily be extended further to tens of millions, ensuring rigorous evaluation as LCLMs continue to scale. LOFT focuses on the following areas where LCLMs have the potential for disruption:

* •

    Retrieval:
    LCLMs can directly ingest and retrieve information from a corpus, eliminating the need for separate dual-encoder models*[[26], [43], [31], [47]]*. This addresses long-standing challenges in retrieval systems such as multi-hop reasoning, instruction following, and few-shot task adaptation.
    We assess retrieval performance across text, visual, and audio modalities.

* •

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
    LCLMs simplify RAG pipelines by directly reasoning over a corpus, overcoming challenges like query decomposition*[[46]]* and mitigating cascading errors due to retrieval misses*[[8], [38]]*.

* •

    SQL:
    We explore LCLMs’ capacity to process entire databases as text, enabling natural language database querying and bypassing conversion to a formal query language like SQL*[[69]]*.
    This potentially enables more expressive querying and handling of noisy or mixed-structured data. Importantly, it can also be seen as a case study representing the ability of LCLMs to subsume other types of structured data and complicated formal languages to query them, such as knowledge graphs that often require bespoke solutions.

* •

    Many-Shot ICL:
    LCLMs can scale the number of examples from the tens in the traditional in-context learning setup to hundreds or thousands*[[65], [10]]*, removing the need to find the optimal set of few-shot examples to use*[[39]]*.

The LOFT benchmark opens up a novel line of research on long-context prompting, which we introduce as Corpus-in-Context (CiC) Prompting ([Section 3]). Using this approach, we evaluate Gemini 1.5 Pro*[[52]]*, GPT-4o*[[45]]*, and Claude 3 Opus*[[4]]* on LOFT. Figure[1] summarizes the performance of these LCLMs and specialized models that were carefully hand-optimized for each task, showcasing how LCLMs can tackle LOFT tasks without specialized pipelines.

Our evaluation on LOFT reveals several key insights when comparing state-of-the-art LCLMs with specialized, task-specific models. At the 128k token level, the largest size comparable across all models, LCLMs rival the performance of Gecko*[[31]]*, a leading textual retrieval system. Notably, Gemini*[[52]]* also surpasses strong multi-modal retrieval models such as CLIP*[[47]]*. However, LCLMs lag significantly on complex multi-hop compositional reasoning tasks, indicating substantial room for improvement.
Furthermore, rigorous ablations reveal large performance variance depending on prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought reasoning, underscoring the need for further research to enhance LCLMs robustness and instructability.
Taken together, our results on LOFT demonstrate that LCLMs can match the performance of many specialized models, while also revealing ample headroom for improvement in robust long-context reasoning as context windows continue to scale.

*Table 1:  Tasks and datasets in the LOFT benchmark. LOFT has 6 types of tasks, 4 modalities, and 35 datasets in total.
For each dataset, we show the average length of the candidates (Avg. Cand. Length) as well as the number of candidates (# Cand) in the 128k version of LOFT.
More details on the datasets are available in [Appendices A], [B] and[C].*

The LOFT benchmark aims to cover a wide range of real-world applications where LCLMs can be employed. These tasks range from retrieving relevant documents for a query to extracting compositional information from databases. [Table 1] lists all tasks and their corresponding datasets.

For each dataset in all tasks, we sample up to 100 test queries, 5 few-shot queries, and 10 development queries.
To test how LCLMs perform when scaling the number of tokens in their context, we create LOFT with three different context length limits, namely 32k222Since the gold documents of 100 test queries alone often exceed 32k tokens, we do not include test queries for the 32k version. We report the development set performance for 32k instead., 128k, and 1M. LOFT currently supports 1 million token contexts, but with the increasing capabilities of state-of-the-art LCLMs, our method allows LOFT to easily scale to larger context lengths (e.g., 1 billion tokens) in the future.
To allow testing the same set of queries over different context lengths, we process each dataset to have the same evaluation queries across different context lengths (except for SQL as detailed below).

#### Retrieval \& RAG

We include diverse text retrieval and RAG datasets, covering heterogeneous retrieval tasks from BEIR*[[53]]*, multi-turn conversational QA*[[2]]*, multi-hop QA*[[63], [55]]*, as well as multi-target QA that requires set operations such as unions or differences*[[3], [41]]*.
For retrieval, we also include multimodal datasets, covering image, video, and audio*[[64], [62], [15]]*.

<img src='x2.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='282' height='179' />

*Figure 2: Corpus creation for retrieval and RAG.
Given a set of test queries, we use their associated gold passages and other random passages to form the corpus.*

All queries in each retrieval and RAG dataset share a single corpus, mimicking real retrieval applications. To create this shared corpus, we first include all gold passages from few-shot, development and the test queries, and then sample passages uniformly until reaching the desired context size (Figure[2]). This construction ensures smaller corpora (e.g., 128k) are subsets of larger ones (e.g., 1M).
Gold and random passages are shuffled to avoid positional biases.
For fair comparison, specialized retriever models also use the same corpora for the evaluation.

#### Many-shot ICL

We adapt datasets from Big-Bench Hard (BBH)*[[10], [49]]* and LongICLBench (LIB)*[[65], [35]]* to evaluate many-shot in-context learning (ICL) capabilities.
Similar to retrieval, we construct shared many-shot ICL contexts, ensuring training examples in smaller contexts are included in larger ones.
Since all of the many-shot ICL datasets are classification tasks, we guarantee that each class is represented at least once.

#### SQL

We evaluate SQL-like reasoning on Spider, a single-turn text-to-SQL dataset *[[67]]*, and SparC, its multi-turn variant *[[68]]*.
The corpus for each query is an associated database of one or more tables. To construct the corpus for each context length, we must select databases such that all of its tables are no larger than that context length. We do this by selecting the largest databases that will fit into that context. This necessarily means that the databases for the 1M token setting would not fit into the smaller context lengths. Therefore, unlike most of the other tasks that share a corpus, the query sets differ across LOFT sizes.

Given a maximum context length of $N\in{\text{32k},\text{128k},\text{1M}}$, we create a corpus up to a size of $0.9N$, to account for differences in tokenizers, as well as to reserve room for instructions and formatting, which will be explained in more detail in [Section 3].
Please refer to [Appendix A] for more details about how the datasets are selected for each task.

3 Corpus-in-Context Prompting
-------------------------------

Traditionally, utilizing large corpora of passages, data tables, or training examples requires specialized recipes or systems.
LCLMs now enable direct ingestion and processing of entire corpora within their context window. This unlocks a novel prompting-based approach for solving new and existing tasks, which we call Corpus-in-Context prompting (CiC, pronounced "seek").

### 3.1 Prompt Design

CiC prompting effectively combines established prompting strategies, tailoring them to leverage the unique capabilities of LCLMs for learning, retrieving and reasoning over in-context corpora. [Figure 3] illustrates our key design choices, whose effectiveness is rigorously evaluated through extensive ablation studies in [Section 5].

#### Instructions

We first provide task-specific instructions to guide the LCLM’s behaviors*[[27], [59], [14]]*.
As an example, for the retrieval task shown in [Figure 3], we ask the model to read the corpus carefully and find relevant documents to answer the question.

#### Corpus Formatting

We then insert the entire corpus into the prompt.
Each candidate (e.g., passage, image, audio) in a corpus is assigned a unique identifier (ID) that can be referenced as needed for that task.333Original candidate IDs from each dataset were not used as they inadvertently disclose the gold documents. For instance, in retrieval tasks, the LCLMs must output the correct candidate IDs.
The structure of the corpus significantly impacts retrieval performance.
Careful formatting, such as putting document IDs both before and after the passage in text retrieval, can mitigate the effects of causal attention in decoder-only LCLMs and enhance retrieval accuracy.

#### Few-Shot Examples

Providing a limited number of demonstrations helps the LCLM grasp the desired response format and improves task accuracy*[[12]]*. Unlike common approaches where few-shot examples are independent, we ground all examples to the same corpus, aiming to teach the model to also learn more details about the specific corpus it needs to use.444As we will see in [Section 4], carefully positioning the answers of these few-shot examples can guide the model’s attention to areas where it is typically weaker, mitigating ”dead zones” in attention distribution. To facilitate automated evaluation, answers within each few-shot example are formatted as a list (e.g., "Final Answer: [54, 0]" in [Figure 3]), thus guiding the model to generate responses in a similar structure that can be readily parsed and compared against ground truth labels.
Finally, each few-shot example is accompanied by a Chain-of-Thought reasoning*[[44], [60]]*.
We find adding Chain-of-Thought reasoning helps the most on tasks requiring complex multi-hop compositional reasoning.

#### Query Formatting

The query to be evaluated is formatted similar to the few-shot examples. For multi-turn datasets, we prepend previous query turns and model outputs to the current query turn, ensuring that the model’s generation is conditioned on its prior responses.
Based on our query formatting, LCLMs generate tokens that are parsed into the final answer.

<img src='x3.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='830' height='361' />

*Figure 3: Example of Corpus-in-Context Prompting for retrieval.
CiC prompting leverages large language models’ capacity to follow instructions, leverage few-shot examples, and benefit from reasoning demonstrations to retrieve and reason over large corpora provided in context.*

[Appendix D] provides examples of instructions for all datasets in LOFT, along with details on the chain-of-thought reasonings used in this paper.

### 3.2 Design Consideration

Given the variation in instructions, format, and tokenizers across different CiC prompting techniques, the resulting context lengths can differ substantially.
To accommodate this diversity, we allocate ample space for prompt customization, as detailed in [Section 2].
To ensure a fair comparison among LCLMs, we strongly recommend that for each maximum context length of LOFT (e.g., 32k or 128k), the model still uses only the corpus and examples present in that version. We also recommend to evaluate models on the maximum size that can fit into their context length without truncating the corpus or any of the individual examples.

### 3.3 Discussion on Efficiency

Encoding a one million token context can be slow and computationally expensive.
One key advantage of CiC prompting is its compatibility with prefix-caching in autoregressive language models*[[20]]* as the query appears at the end of the prompt.
This means *the corpus only needs to be encoded once*, similar to the indexing process in traditional information retrieval.
As demonstrated in [Section 5], encoding the corpus as the prefix in this way does not lead to a performance drop in LCLMs.

4 LOFT Tasks and Primary Results
--------------------------------

We evaluate three state-of-the-art LCLMs on LOFT: Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro *[[52]]*, OpenAI’s GPT-4o *[[45]]*, and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus *[[4]]*.
We evaluate these models because their APIs support most of the modalities.
Their maximum context lengths are 2M, 128k, and 200k tokens, respectively.
We use their official APIs555[https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api ""),666[https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o ""),777<https://www.anthropic.com/api> for the evaluation.
Their prompts were chosen based on their performance on the development queries over the 128k token context.
While evaluating, a small number of API calls can be blocked due to various reasons such as errors in the safety filters; these examples are treated as incorrect.
In all LOFT tasks, LCLMs without any task-specific fine-tuning are benchmarked against specialized models that have undergone extensive fine-tuning or pipelining for the target task and are therefore limited to that specific domain.
We select each specialized model that exemplifies recent task-specific advancements.

### 4.1 Text Retrieval

<img src='x4.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='290' height='215' />

*Figure 4: Positional Analysis.
We vary gold document positions of queries within the corpus (0% \= beginning, 100% \= end).*

We adopt Gecko*[[31]]*, a state-of-the-art dual encoder as the specialized model for the retrieval task.
Gecko is fine-tuned on extensive text retrieval and similarity tasks.
To ensure fair comparison, we use exactly the same corpus to test both the LCLMs and Gecko, instead of using the full retrieval corpora or published results.

#### Results

[Table 2] demonstrates that Gemini 1.5 Pro performs comparably to Gecko at 128k context length.
Other LCLMs also perform surprisingly well.
This is notable, as LCLMs have not undergone specialized contrastive learning for retrieval. While LCLMs’s performance does degrade when scaling the corpus to millions of tokens ([Figure 5]), the parity at 128k still suggests the potential of LCLMs to be used for retrieval tasks.

<img src='x5.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='830' height='214' />

*Figure 5: Scaling results of LCLMs compared to each specialized model by scaling the corpus size from 32k to 1 million tokens.
Results are averaged over all constituent datasets in each task.*

#### Positional Analysis

To better understand the performance of LCLMs on longer context lengths, we investigate how the positioning of the gold document affects retrieval performance, examining the effect of the gold document for the test query and for the few shot examples within the prompt*[[37]]*.

[Figure 4] reveals that performance drops as the gold documents of the test queries are moved towards the end of the corpus, suggesting reduced attention in later sections of the prompt.
Conversely, placing the gold documents of few-shot queries at the end improves recall, indicating their ability to mitigate attention weaknesses in this region.
Co-locating gold documents of few-shot and test queries consistently boosts performance. This is perhaps unsurprising, as it gives the model information about where to look for the answer; however, it also indicates that the model does indeed pay special attention to the locations where the gold documents for the few-shot examples are placed, regardless of where they are in the corpus. This offers a promising approach to overcome performance degradation in large corpora.
Per-dataset analysis is provided in [Appendix E].

### 4.2 Visual Retrieval

We employ CLIP-L/14*[[47]]*, a widely used text-to-image retrieval model, as our specialized model. For Flickr30k and MS-COCO, CLIP performs text-to-image retrieval. For MSR-VTT, it performs text-to-video retrieval by averaging scores across frames. For OVEN, due to the lack of suitable open-source image-to-text models, we approximate image-to-text retrieval by using CLIP’s text-to-image retrieval.
Evaluation of Claude 3 Opus on this task was not feasible due to the current limitation of 20 images per API request.

#### Results

Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforms GPT-4o across all four visual benchmarks ([Table 2]).
Notably, as shown in Figure[5], Gemini 1.5 Pro maintains a performance advantage over CLIP across all visual benchmarks and context lengths.

### 4.3 Audio Retrieval

We choose PaLM 2 DE*[[19]]* as a specialized model, which is a dual-encoder trained to maximize the similarity between audio and their transcription and has achieved previous state-of-the-art on the FLEURS datasets.
Currently, GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus do not support audio input.

#### Results

Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrates comparable performance to PaLM 2 DE across all 5 languages ([Table 2]). We notice that Gemini 1.5 Pro notably surpasses PaLM 2 DE in Hindi; this advantage likely stems from differences in pre-training data between Gemini and PaLM. [Figure 5] further confirms Gemini 1.5 Pro’s robust performance across various context length, highlighting the current capabilities of LCLMs while also indicating the need for more challenging audio datasets.

### 4.4 RAG

We set up a retrieve-and-read RAG pipeline as a specialized model, using Gecko*[[31]]* to retrieve the top-40 documents which are then put into the context of Gemini 1.5 Pro and used to generate the answer conditioned on the question and the retrieved documents.

#### Results

[Table 2] demonstrates that Gemini 1.5 Pro, with the entire corpus in context, outperforms the RAG pipeline on multi-hop datasets (HotpotQA and MusiQue). This is because LCLMs can reason over multiple passages in the context window using Chain-of-Thought*[[60]]*, a capability that RAG pipelines typically lack unless they have a separate module for planning and reasoning.

However, a specialized retriever like Gecko excels at ranking all topically relevant passages from a corpus, enabling it to identify a comprehensive set of passages covering all answers. This proves particularly beneficial for multi-target datasets, such as QUEST and QAMPARI.

[Figure 5] reveals that while LCLMs match RAG performance at 128k compared to a pipeline, performance drops at 1M corresponding to the drop found in LCLM text retrieval performance.

| Dataset | Dev (32k) | Test (128k) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NQ | 0.60 (-0.10) | 0.37 (-0.47) |
| HotPotQA | 0.60 (-0.30) | 0.33 (-0.42) |
| MuSiQue | 0.20 (-0.60) | 0.10 (-0.45) |

*Table 3: Gemini’s closed-book performance on RAG.
Red indicates the performance difference compared to the CiC prompting.*

#### Closed-Book Ablations

To further probe LCLMs capabilities, we conduct closed-book ablations on Gemini 1.5 Pro. In this setting, we remove the corpus from the context to assess LCLM performance based solely on parametric knowledge*[[33], [38]]*. [Table 3] presents the results, revealing that the closed-book performance significantly lags behind the long-context and specialized models.
This underscores the tested models’ effectiveness in leveraging the external corpus to enhance its reasoning capabilities.

### 4.5 SQL-Like Compositional Reasoning

<img src='x6.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='282' height='215' />

*Figure 6: SQL Reasoning Analysis.
We bin Spider queries by operators in their SQL query and report binned Gemini performance.
We group min and max into a bin and > and < into another bin.*

The traditional SQL pipeline uses a trained semantic parser to translate the natural language input into a SQL query.
Then, a separate SQL interpreter is used to execute the SQL query over the database.
As a specialized model, we use DAIL-SQL*[[18]]* for the semantic parser, which prompts an LLM to provide the SQL query.
We adapt DAIL-SQL by replacing its LLM with Gemini 1.5 Pro and using a fixed set of few-shot examples.

#### Results

Results in [Table 2] show that LCLMs achieve reasonable performance, though they are significantly behind the specialized pipeline. This reveals substantial headroom to enhance the compositional reasoning capabilities of LCLMs.

Lower performance than the specialized pipeline on the SQL task is unsurprising, given the decades of work on semantic parsing and SQL.
Nonetheless, this performance still reveals the potential for the model to handle complex structured data with no task-specific tuning.

#### Reasoning Analysis

To gain insights into the short-comings of LCLMs in complex compositional reasoning, we categorize queries based on the operators in the gold SQL queries and measure Gemini 1.5 Pro’s performance for each operator. [Figure 6] shows that averaging is the most difficult operation while counting is relatively easy.
Moreover, we find that reasoning over equality is considerably easier than reasoning over inequality.

### 4.6 Many-Shot ICL

*Figure 7: ICL Performance as we scale the percentage of examples used up to 100%.*

#### Results

[Table 2] compares accuracy for each of the LCLMs across all ICL datasets.
For BBH, we report the accuracy on 32k, which is the maximum context length available.
Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforms GPT-4o on all benchmarks, except for BBH-tracking7 where Gemini performs surprisingly poorly.
On average, Claude 3 Opus achieves the best performance among LCLMs on this task.

#### Scaling Many Shot ICL

[Figure 7] illustrates the impact of increasing the number of examples in Gemini.
In LIB-dialog, accuracy improves monotonically with more examples.
In contrast, results on BBH are mixed.
Knowledge-intensive tasks like BBH-date and BBH-salient see monotonic improvements similar to LIB-dialog, while reasoning-intensive tasks like BBH-tracking7 and BBH-web do not benefit.
These results suggest that more complicated tasks may see an earlier limit in how much models can learn from scaling the number of in-context examples.

5 CiC Prompt Ablations
----------------------

We conduct ablations over the different facets of the CiC Prompt. Examples of the prompt for each ablation can be found in [Appendix F].
For the ablations, we evaluate Gemini 1.5 Pro on the 128k version of LOFT.

|  | ($\Delta$) | - | (-0.02) | (-0.13) | (-0.03) | (-0.30) | (-0.05) | (-0.09) | (-0.03) |

*Table 4: Ablation results of Gemini 1.5 Pro on different tasks in LOFT at 128k context length.
Starting from our best prompt format (used in the rest of the experiments), individual facets of the corpus, query, and instruction are ablated to surface their relative effect on quality.
Since ArguAna and FIQA do not have any title for each passage, we report the average and its difference without these two datasets for the Titles Only ablation.*

The ablations show the effectiveness of our CiC prompting design.
Removing task-specific instructions (Generic Instruction) or Chain-of-Thought reasoning (Without CoT) both lead to worse performance. We also observe a performance decrease for Corpus in Each Few-Shot. In this setting, instead of using a shared corpus, each few-shot example has its own small corpus consisting of nine random passages and one gold passage. This performance degradation could be either because the few-shot examples help the model attend to the test corpus or because the few-shot task becomes much easier than the evaluation task.

Placing the query at the beginning of the prompt instead of at the end (Query at Beginning) led to a significant and consistent performance decrease across tasks and models.
This result suggests that prefix-caching actually works better than encoding the corpus conditioned on each query, which would be much more expensive.

<img src='x8.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='282' height='320' />

*Figure 8: Effect of the number of few-shot examples.
The performance increases with the number of few-shot examples.*

The presentation of document IDs also affects performance. In particular, replacing monotonic numerical IDs with random (Alphanumeric IDs) negatively impacts performance in most datasets. This could possibly be due to way in which numbers are tokenized, with fewer tokens for certain numbers.
Only placing the IDs at the front of the document instead of at the front and the back (Without ID Echo) also resulted in a 5% performance drop, confirming that repeating text can compensate for missing context in autoregressive language models *[[48]]*.

To test if the model is simply using parametric knowledge instead of grounding on the context, we remove the document content and simply keep the document title and ID in the corpus (Title Only). In this case, it would imply the model is able to perform well because it has already seen all of the datasets we are evaluating on during training. Across all experiments, this ablation significantly degraded performance, indicating the model indeed relies on the provided context.

We also study how the number of few-shot examples in the prompt affects quality.
The results can be found in [Figure 8].
Increasing the number of examples improves the quality on the retrieval task, from 0.76 at zero-shot to 0.81 at 5-shots.
Finally, qualitative analysis on the model outputs is provided in [Appendix G].

6 Related Work
--------------

Evaluating LCLMs remains a challenge due to the limitations of existing benchmarks.
Many popular datasets and methods rely on synthetic tasks *[[50]]* such as the popular "Needle-in-A-Haystack" retrieval *[[25]]* or its extension to multi-hop QA *[[32]]*.
While these evaluations are also scalable to arbitrarily long contexts, they do not fully capture the nuances of real-world retrieval or reasoning tasks*[[23]]*.
Some recent benchmarks leverage existing NLP datasets for tasks such as extreme summarization and multi-document QA *[[6]]*.
However, these tasks lack the dynamic scaling capabilities of synthetic benchmarks, which makes them difficult to adapt to very long contexts.

LongAlpaca *[[13]]* and LongBench-Chat *[[5]]* evaluate instruction-following under long context settings but contain relatively low task diversity and no examples beyond 100k context length. Similar to LOFT, Ada-LEval *[[58]]* proposes a length-adaptable benchmark; however, their tasks are somewhat synthetic and may not resemble real-world applications.

Also related to our work is *[[37]]*, which applies LCLMs to long-context QA using the top retrieved documents from Natural Questions, similar to specialized models for RAG in LOFT.
They find that LCLMs lose recall when relevant information is placed in the middle of the context.
However, their analysis is limited to contexts that are under 10k tokens.
We extend this type of evaluation of LCLMs to context lengths of up to 1M tokens in addition to using multiple modalities and additional forms of reasoning. Finally, our work connects to the field of generative retrieval*[[16], [51]]*, where models are trained to memorize and generate retrieval targets. Our research offers an alternative approach where the retrieval corpus is directly provided as context, eliminating task specific training.

7 Conclusion
------------

As language models improve and scale, their ability to retrieve and reason over increasingly long context will unlock unprecedented use-cases.
To measure this progress, we introduce LOFT, the Long Context Frontiers benchmark. LOFT is a suite of tasks that rigorously assesses LCLMs on tasks ripe for a paradigm shift: retrieval, retrieval-augmented generation, SQL-like reasoning, and in-context learning. LOFT provides dynamic scaling of context lengths of up to 1 million tokens, ensuring that evaluations remain relevant as LCLMs continue to evolve. The tasks can be further scaled up with minimal effort to 1 billion tokens as context lengths continue to increase.
Initial findings demonstrate that despite having never been trained to do retrieval, LCLMs have retrieval capabilities rivaling task-specific hand-crafted SOTA retrieval systems.
Nevertheless, there remains considerable room for advancement in long-context reasoning, particularly as models gain access to even longer context windows.
We believe that LOFT provides a fertile testing ground for measuring progress in long-context modeling.

#### Limitations

Our experiments were constrained by the computational resources and financial costs associated with utilizing LCLMs.
The entire LOFT 128k test sets contain around $35\text{ datasets}\times 100\text{ prompts}\times 128\text{k}\text{ tokens}\=44%
8\text{M}$ input tokens, which cost $\$1,568$ for Gemini 1.5 Pro, $\$2,240$ for GPT-4o, and $\$6,720$ for Claude 3 Opus at the time of writing. To reduce costs, we also release dev sets, which are 10x smaller and can be evaluated with around $\$200$ using Gemini 1.5 Pro or GPT-4o. We also expect LLM API prices to decrease over time.
Another limitation of this work is that we focused on evaluating the quality of LCLMs, and leave efficiency considerations for future work. We could not measure the efficiency improvements from prefix caching *[[20]]* due to API constraints at the time of writing. Without caching, the Gemini 1.5 Pro API has a median latency of roughly four seconds for 32k input tokens, twelve seconds for 128k input tokens, and 100 seconds for 1 million input tokens. This speed is likely slower than specialized retrievers or SQL databases; the promising quality results on LOFT encourage further investigation into optimizing LCLMs efficiency.
Additionally, our retrieval and RAG tasks was limited to 1 million tokens, which still leaves a large gap from real-world applications that may involve several million or even billions of documents.

Appendix A LOFT Dataset Creation
--------------------------------

### A.1 Dataset Selection

#### Text Retrieval \& RAG

We test single-document retrieval on a representative subset of the BEIR benchmark*[[53]]*, prioritizing datasets with high-quality ground truth labels*[[56], [54], [40], [7], [29], [57]]*.
We also include TopiOCQA*[[2]]*, which is a multi-turn conversational retrieval dataset.
We measure performance on single-document retrieval using Recall@1.
Additionally, we test multi-document retrieval on HotPotQA*[[63]]*, MuSiQue*[[55]]*, QAMPARI*[[41]]*, where a set of documents must be retrieved to answer the query.
The evaluation metric for multi-document retrieval is MRecall@$k$*[[42]]*, which gives a score of 1.0 if all $k$ gold set items are retrieved in top-$k$ and 0.0 otherwise.
When creating the LOFT version of the multi-document retrieval datasets, we limit the number of relevant documents per query to $k\=2$, 5, 5, and 3 for HotPotQA, MuSiQue, QAMPARI, and QUEST, respectively, and the corresponding $k$’s are used for MRecall@$k$ (e.g. HotPotQA uses MRecall@2).

Our RAG task contains subsets of retrieval datasets, which have phrase-level answer annotations: Natural Questions, TopiOCQA, HotPotQA, MuSiQue, QAMPARI, and QUEST.
We use subspan exact match (EM)*[[1]]* for evaluating performance of all the datasets.
In case of multi-answer datasets (i.e. QAMPARI, QUEST), we first match predicted answers to gold standard answers based on whether they overlap*[[17]]* via linear sum assignment algorithm. We then give full credit if every gold answer has a perfect match with aligned predicted answers.

#### Visual Retrieval

We employ four diverse visual benchmarks: Flickr30k*[[64]]* and MSCOCO*[[36]]* for text-to-image retrieval; MSR-VTT*[[62]]* for text-to-video retrieval (sampling 3 frames per video); and OVEN*[[24]]* using the entity split for image-text retrieval where both queries and retrieval targets consist of image-text pairs.
All images are resized to 512x512 and performance is assessed using Recall@1 for all datasets.

#### Audio Retrieval

We utilize a subset of the multilingual FLEURS dataset*[[15]]*, focusing on the five most spoken languages888<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers>: English (en), Hindi (hi), Chinese (zh), Spanish (es), and French (fr).
Recall@1 is employed as the evaluation metric, given the single gold target.

#### SQL

We evaluate SQL-like reasoning on Spider, a single-turn text-to-SQL dataset *[[67]]*, and SparC, its multi-turn variant *[[68]]*.
The input contains the database tables serialized as CSV and the natural language question.
The model is allowed to perform reasoning in natural language before giving the final answer,
which must be formatted in a Markdown code block.
The extracted answers are evaluated against the execution results of the gold SQL queries.
For SparC, the multi-turn questions are provided one-by-one in a conversational format, and credit is awarded only when the answers of all steps are correct.

#### Many-shot ICL

We investigate LCLMs’ many-shot ICL capabilities by repurposing datasets from Big Bench Hard (BBH)*[[10], [49]]* and LongICLBench (LIB)*[[66], [35]]* to fit a many-shot ICL setting, focusing on multi-class classification tasks.
The first set of datasets is drawn from Big-Bench Hard and includes: date_understanding (BBH-date), salient_error_translation_detection (BBH-salient), tracking_shuffled_objects_seven_objects (BBH-tracking7), and web_of_lies (BBH-web), each with up to 150 examples for prompting and up to 7 classes.
Unlike other LOFT tasks, the full corpus fits within 32k tokens which leads us to also create variants from 2k to 32k context lengths.
We use accuracy as our metric for Big Bench Hard.
We also evaluate with DialogRE*[[66]]*, a dialogue-based relation classification dataset with 36 relation labels.
We follow the LongICLBench format but use accuracy as our metric.

Appendix B Datasets Processing Details
--------------------------------------

#### Content Filtering

The language model APIs often block inputs with potentially harmful contents. When creating LOFT, we tried to remove such contents from textual and visual inputs. Our filtering was done using a classifier as well as a keyword-based filtering. Despite our best effort, some API calls still refused to provide answers, which we treated as incorrect in our evaluation.

#### Tokenization

To measure the size of a corpus, we count the number of tokens returned by the SentencePiece tokenizer*[[28]]*.

Then format the answer into a list of lists. When formatting the answer into a list of lists, make sure you use the exact fields that are provided in the tables. |

*Table 6:  Instructions used for each LOFT dataset.
We omit instructions for the RAG datasets, which are almost identical to text retrieval instructions.
The ICL task does not use additional instructions, but only many-shot examples in their context.*

### D.2 Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

We used two types of chain-of-thought reasoning in the few-shot examples in the prompts:

* •

    Handwritten reasoning. For multi-hop retrieval and RAG datasets (HotPotQA and MuSiQue), as well as SQL datasets (Spider and SparC), we manually wrote reasoning chains for the few-shot queries.

* •

    Relevant content. For the rest of the retrieval and RAG datasets, we simply let the model generate the title (or the passage if the title is not available) of each gold document before generating the final answers. This helps explain why the final answers (IDs or short phrases) are the correct ones.

Many-shot ICL task did not use any chain-of-thought reasoning.
We also noticed that GPT-4o performed much better without chain-of-thought reasoning, so the GPT-4o results presented in this paper did not utilize the chain-of-thought.

| Dataset \= Spider 1M | |
| Input | CiC-prompt(query\="Find the year which offers the largest number of courses.") |
| Output | Here’s a step-by-step approach using the provided tables: |
|  | **1. Identify relevant data:** |
|  | We need to look at the "year" column in the "section" table, which lists the year each course section was offered. |
|  | **2. Count courses per year:** |
|  | Group the data by “year” and count the number of unique “course_id” values for each year. This will give us the number of distinct courses offered in each year. |
|  | **3. Find the year with the maximum count:** |
|  | Identify the year with the highest count of distinct courses. |
|  | **Based on the data provided, here’s the breakdown of courses per year:** |
|  | | Year | Number of Courses | |
|  | |—|—| |
|  | | 2001 | 29 | |
|  | | 2002 | 36 | |
|  | | 2003 | 38 | |
|  | | 2004 | 31 | |
|  | | 2005 | 31 | |
|  | | 2006 | 41 | |
|  | | 2007 | 40 | |
|  | | 2008 | 37 | |
|  | | 2009 | 35 | |
|  | | 2010 | 39 | |
|  | **The year 2006 has the largest number of courses offered (41).** |
|  | Final Answer: ['2006'] (✓) |
| Input | CiC-prompt(query\="List total amount of invoice from Chicago, IL.") |
| Output | Here’s a step-by-step approach using the provided tables: |
|  | **1. Identify relevant data:** |
|  | * **Invoices:** This table contains the billing city and total for each invoice. |
|  | **2. Filter invoices from Chicago, IL:** |
|  | * Scan through the “billing_city” column and identify invoices where the city is “Chicago” and the state is “IL”. |
|  | * **Based on the data provided, invoices 24, 92, 103, 158, 287, 310, 332, and 384 are from Chicago, IL.** |
|  | **3. Sum the total amounts:** |
|  | * Add up the "total" values for the invoices identified in step 2. |
|  | * **The total amounts for the invoices are 1.98, 1.98, 15.86, 8.91, 1.98, 7.96, 5.94, and 0.99, respectively.** |
|  | * **The sum of these amounts is 36.6.** |
|  | **4. Present the result:** |
|  | * The final output will be a single value representing the total amount of invoices from Chicago, IL. |
|  | Final Answer: ['36.6'] (✗) |
