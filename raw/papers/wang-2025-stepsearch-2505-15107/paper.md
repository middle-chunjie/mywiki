###### Abstract

Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2% absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our code will be released on <https://github.com/Zillwang/StepSearch>

1 Introduction
--------------

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in sophisticated linguistic comprehension and generative tasks.

Reinforcement learning enhanced architectures(e.g., OpenAI-o3*[openaio1]*, DeepSeek-R1*[deepseekr1]*, and Kimi-1.5*[kimik1.5]*) employ policy-gradient methods (PPO*[schulman2017proximalpolicyoptimizationalgorithms]*, GRPO*[shao2024deepseekmathpushinglimitsmathematical]*) to advance multi-hop logical reasoning*[xie2025logicrlunleashingllmreasoning]*. However, complex multi-hop QA still suffers from intrinsic knowledge gaps*[lee2024multirerankermaximizingperformanceretrievalaugmented]* and static, inefficient knowledge-assimilation mechanisms*[jin2024longcontextllmsmeetrag] ; [schick2023toolformer]*. To address limited modeling of internal dependencies, recent work has adopted prompting strategies, RAG architectures, and tailored learning paradigms*[patil2025advancingreasoninglargelanguage] ; [lewis2020retrieval]*.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting*[wei2022chain]* decomposes complex inference into sequential subtasks but remains highly sensitive to prompt formulation and does not eliminate hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*[lewis2020retrieval]* dynamically incorporates external corpora to bridge knowledge gaps and suppress spurious content*[zhao2024retrievalaugmentedgenerationaigeneratedcontent] ; [gupta2024comprehensivesurveyretrievalaugmentedgeneration] ; [ragsurvey]*; embedding structured knowledge graphs further enforces semantic coherence through explicit entity relations*[soman2024biomedicalknowledgegraphoptimizedprompt] ; [edge2025localglobalgraphrag]*. Agentic frameworks—combining self-reflection, strategic planning, and multi-agent collaboration—facilitate adaptive task decomposition and iterative refinement*[singh2025agenticretrievalaugmentedgenerationsurvey] ; [li2025searcho1agenticsearchenhancedlarge]*. Advanced retrieval tactics (query reformulation, reranking, hybrid vector–keyword indexing) bolster multi-hop reasoning while filtering noise*[glass2022re2gretrievererankgenerate] ; [Sawarkar_2024]*. Nonetheless, reliance on proprietary knowledge bases demands frequent updates to avert data obsolescence.

Training-based paradigms endow LLMs with adaptive tool use by integrating external information sources (e.g., search engines) directly into the training loop. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) frameworks—such as ToolFormer*[schick2023toolformer]*, ToolKengPT*[hao2023toolkengpt]*, and related efforts*[qu2025tool] ; [shi2025toollearningwildempowering]*—substantially boost performance in specialized, knowledge-intensive tasks but suffer from poor out-of-domain generalization*[chu2025sftmemorizesrlgeneralizes]*.

Recent advances have adopted reinforcement learning to learn dynamic retrieval policies, enabling models to iteratively query and integrate external knowledge based on the static RAG paradigm*[huang2025ragrladvancingretrievalaugmentedgeneration] ; [jiang2025deepretrievalhackingrealsearch]*. Methods such as R1-Searcher*[jin2025searchr1trainingllmsreason]*, Search-R1*[song2025r1searcherincentivizingsearchcapability]*, ReSearch*[chen2025researchlearningreasonsearch]* and ZeroSearch*[sun2025zerosearchincentivizesearchcapability]* rely on answer and format-level rewards, empower agents to autonomously invoke search tools and achieve QA performance surpassing conventional RAG. DeepResearcher*[zheng2025deepresearcherscalingdeepresearch]* further extends this paradigm to unconstrained online search environments, highlighting the scalability and potential of search-RL approaches. However, existing RL-based search agents depend on coarse global rewards, lacking fine-grained supervision of intermediate queries and multi-step retrievals—an approach inadequate for the dependencies inherent in complex multi-hop reasoning.

Process-level supervision enables the design of fine-grained reward functions that steer strategic query planning and enhance retrieval quality in complex search environments *[zhu2025chainofthoughtmattersimprovinglongcontext] ; [ye2025uncertaintyawarestepwiseverificationgenerative] ; [ye2025processsupervisedreinforcementlearningcode] ; [corag]*. However, existing step-reward methods—such as R1-VL *[zhang2025r1vllearningreasonmultimodal]* for pure logical reasoning and RPO *[liu2024practoptimizingprincipledreasoning]* lack true token-level supervision for interactive retrieval tasks. Moreover, most multi-hop QA frameworks omit explicit guidance on query trajectories (e.g., intermediate search keywords or document usage), leaving a critical gap in search-path modeling.

*Figure 2: Step-wise search involves interactive rounds, with information gain being rewarded and redundancy penalised. Each interaction evaluates thinking and searching behaviour based on the retrieved results, with the final answer being used as the basis for global rewards.*

To address these shortcomings, We propose StepSearch, a reinforcement learning framework that integrates iterative retrieval with explicit step-wise supervision for search llms (Figure[2]). Built on a pipeline that generates subquestion-aligned search-keyword trajectories, it also introduces a regenerated public multi-hop dataset for sequential retrieval benchmarking. By augmenting PPO with token-level rewards that combine information gain and redundancy penalties, StepSearch boosts policy convergence and improves retrieval fidelity and QA accuracy.

In general, our core contribution lies in:

$\bullet$ Universal multi-hop search data. We develop a novel MuSiQue-based pipeline, contributing 60k filtered sub-question search keywords that generalize across retrieval datasets.

$\bullet$ StepSearch: Step-wise RL with dual rewards. We augment PPO with token-level rewards—information gain and redundancy penalties—for both query formulation and document retrieval.

$\bullet$ State-of-the-art performance. StepSearch outperforms standard RL baselines by 5.7%, 9.1%, 10.0%, and 15.2% absolutely on diverse multi-hop QA benchmarks.

2 Methodology
-------------

### 2.1 Data Augmentation Pipeline

In this pilot study, we construct a multi-turn Q\&A dataset with subquestion-level search trajectories. Starting from the MusiQue *[trivedi2022musique]* dataset, our pipeline show as (Figure.[3]):

<img src='x2.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='332' height='402' />

*Figure 3: Data pipeline for generating the corresponding search query for the Q\&A intermediate process.*

1. (a)

    Leverage GPT-4o. to enrich decomposed MuSiQue questions with coherent subquestion–answer pairs, then derive $N$ search queries per step for retrieval.

2. (b)

    Each enhanced step question is then reformulated into a set of $N$ search queries to facilitate information retrieval.

3. (c)

    Queries are issued to $M$ sources (e.g., Google, Bing, Wiki-18), and only those returning valid results in at least $\lceil M/2\rceil$ sources are retained.

### 2.2 Train LLM with Search Actions

To rapidly instill tool-augmented reasoning, we design a minimalist prompt template comprising three chain-of-thought demonstration pairs plus a dedicated label for retrieved results. Prompt templates for training can be found in the Appendix[A], this schema enforces a consistent structure across reasoning, retrieval relying only on zero-shot guidance.

Rollout and Mask for Retrieve:(1) We run the loop of <think>…</think>, <search>…</search>, <information>…</information> iteratively, appending external docs until LLM returns <answer>…</answer> or the action budget is reached. (2) During RL training, we optimize a composite loss but mask out all <information>…</information> segments from gradient computation, thereby decoupling parameter updates from retrieval artifacts and focusing learning on the model’s internal reasoning and search-policy parameters, as established in prior search-RL work*[jin2025searchr1trainingllmsreason] ; [song2025r1searcherincentivizingsearchcapability] ; [chen2025researchlearningreasonsearch] ; [sun2025zerosearchincentivizesearchcapability] ; [zheng2025deepresearcherscalingdeepresearch]*.

### 2.3 StepSearch

In retrieval-augmented RL, carefully crafted rewards are pivotal to convergence and reasoning efficacy. In addition to the standard format and final-answer reward $r_{\text{answer}}$, we introduce a search-key reward $r_{\text{key}}$ to promote informative query issuance directly. Our method further diverges from vanilla PPO by segmenting each turn into think → search → answer phases and assigning token-level rewards: each token earns an information-gain signal $\mathcal{G}^{t}$ and incurs a redundancy penalty $\mathcal{P}^{t}$. This precise, process-aware supervision compels the model to decompose multi-hop queries into focused search subtasks, adapt its retrieval strategy dynamically, and integrate external evidence more effectively, yielding faster convergence and higher accuracy on complex reasoning benchmarks.

<img src='extracted/6478144/figures/StePPO1.png' alt='Refer to caption' title='' width='574' height='292' />

*Figure 4: Overview of StepSearch. At each step, the model issues queries to an external engine and receives snippets. Search Step Reward score, combining information gain and redundancy penalty, are applied to tokens within each round, while the global reward, based on final answer accuracy and keyword hit rate, is applied at the last token. Retrieved content is masked during training to isolate the model’s generative parameters.*

Our optimization algorithm combines the above-mentioned Search Steps supervision reward based on the currently widely used actor-critic approach PPO*[schulman2017proximalpolicyoptimizationalgorithms]*, denote as StePPO. For each sample input $x\backsim\mathcal{D}$, obtain output $o$ from the old policy $\pi_{\theta_{old}}$, let $I(y_{t})$ be the token-loss masking indicator, it equals 1 when $o_{t}$ is generated by actor LLM else 0 for retrieved tokens. Then optimize the policy $\pi_{\theta}$ with the reference policy $\pi_{\theta_{ref}}$ by maximizing the following objective:

|  |  | $\displaystyle\mathcal{J}_{\text{StePPO}}(\theta)\=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D},% o\sim\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\cdot|x)}$ |  | (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | $\displaystyle\Bigg{{}\frac{1}{\sum_{t\=1}^{\ |o\ | |

here, $\epsilon$ is a hyper-parameter for clipping to stalblilize training, and $A_{t}$ represents the estimated advantage computed with GAE algorithm*[schulman2015high]*, based on future rewards ${r_{\geq t}}$, which is composed of the gloabal and step-wise search round rewards, and a learned value function $V_{\phi}$. The global reward is set at the last position of the output, while the step-wise reward is set at the last token of each round of search behavior.

#### 2.3.1 Type 1 Reward: Global Signal

Format Requirement: To ensure the model adopts the prescribed multi-step "search + reason" workflow and correctly initiates search actions across iterative reasoning rounds, we enforce strict format validation as a hard constraint rather than implement it as an explicit reward. The required output format is defined as follows:

* •

    Only the search queries in the proper <search>…</search> pairs will be extracted and used to call search tools, and the answer must be in the <answer>…</answer> pair.

* •

    At least one round of "think" and "search" behaviour

* •

    Only one <answer>…</answer> tag pair to answer the question, and it must be at the end.

Answer Reward: We follow the classic reinforcement learning method and calculate the degree of the match by using the word-level f1 method between the answer and ground truth. Let $PN$ represent the word count of the predicted answer, $RN$ for word count of the golden answer and $IN$ stands for the word count of the intersection between them, then the answer reward $r_{\text{answer}}$ can be defined as:

|  | $\text{F1}(x,y)\=\frac{2*IN}{PN+RN}$ |  | (2) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  | $r_{\mathrm{answer}}\=\begin{cases}\mathrm{F1}(a_{\mathrm{pred}},\,a_{\mathrm{gt% }}),\&\text{format is correct},\\ 0,\&\text{format is incorrect}.\end{cases}$ |  | (3) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Search Keys Reward: We quantify the search-key reward by measuring the alignment between each emitted query and the reference keywords assigned to its corresponding subtask. Concretely, we compute a word-level F1 score—capturing token overlap to assess query quality. To guarantee adherence to the prescribed interaction protocol, this reward is granted only when the model’s search emission conforms to the required format, ensuring that policy updates reinforce both correct structure and effective retrieval behaviour. Suppose there are $T$ rounds of queries $Q\={q_{1},q_{2},\dots,q_{T}}$, $K_{i}\={k_{i1},k_{i2},\dots,k_{iN_{i}}},i\=1,\dots,M$ corresponding $M$ subquestions which each contains $N_{i}$ related golden queries, thus, the search keyword reward can be calculated as:

|  | $f_{ijt}\=\text{F1}(q_{t},k_{ij}),$ |  | (4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  | $\displaystyle r_{\text{key}}$ | $\displaystyle\=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i\=1}^{M}\Biggl{(}\max_{1\leq j\leq N_{i}}\Bigl{% (}\max_{1\leq t\leq T}f_{ijt}\Bigr{)}\Biggr{)}\=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i\=1}^{M}\max_{% 1\leq j\leq N_{i}}\max_{1\leq t\leq T}f_{ijt}.$ |  | (5) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Type 1 Reward: Set $\gamma_{\text{key}}$ as the scale factor and the final reward rule can be expressed by the following formula:

|  | $r_{\text{overall}}\=r_{\text{answer}}+\gamma_{\text{key}}\cdot r_{\text{key}}.$ |  | (6) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### 2.3.2 Type 2 Reward: Search Step

The step-wise reward $r_{\text{step}}^{t}$ of each round of search behaviour can be expressed as information gain $\mathcal{G}^{t}$ minus redundancy penalty $\mathcal{P}^{t}$ as Type 2 Reward:

|  | $r_{\text{step}}^{t}\=\mathcal{G}^{t}-\mathcal{P}^{t}.$ |  | (7) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Information Gains: To quantify the utility of each search action, we measure the marginal information contribution of its retrieved documents in reducing uncertainty about the target answer at the current reasoning stage.

Let $D^{g}\={d^{g}_{1},\dots,d^{g}_{n}}$ denote the $n$ ground-truth documents required to resolve problem $p$ at search turn $t$, where each $d^{g}_{i}$ contains the gold-standard information for a specific subtask. We maintain a memory vector $M^{t}\=[m^{t}_{1},\dots,m^{t}_{n}]$, in which $m^{t}_{i}$ records the maximum similarity observed to date between any retrieved document and $d^{g}_{i}$. At turn $t$, the agent retrieves a set $D^{r(t)}\={d^{r(t)}_{1},\dots,d^{r(t)}_{k}}$ of $k$ documents; we denote by $c^{t}_{j}$ the similarity between $d^{r(t)}_{j}$ and its corresponding golden document(s). To evaluate this alignment, we adopt a submodular coverage function instantiated with cosine similarity over TF–IDF *[ramos2003using]* representations, which naturally enforces diminishing returns and penalizes redundant retrievals.

First initialize $m^{t}_{i}$ to 0, the current matching degree of the round $t$ search results can be calculated based on each golden info document, and the highest similarity among the search documents in this round is taken as $c^{t}_{i}$:

|  | $c^{t}_{i}\=\max_{1\leq j\leq k}\frac{\overrightarrow{d^{g}_{i}}\cdot% \overrightarrow{d^{r(t)}_{j}}}{||\overrightarrow{d^{g}_{i}}||\cdot||% \overrightarrow{d^{r(t)}_{j}}||},\quad i\=1,\cdots,n.$ |  | (8) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The valuable information gain $\triangle_{i}^{t}$ on golden document $d^{g}_{i}$ of this round $t$ is calculated based on the current matching degree $c^{t}_{i}$ of this round and the global maximum matching degree $m^{t}_{i}$ of the previous round:

|  | $\triangle_{i}^{t}\=\max(c^{t}_{i}-m^{t}_{i},0),\quad i\=1,\cdots,n,$ |  | (9) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

then, the overall information gain value of $t$th round is the average gain of n golden info documents in the current round:

|  | $\mathcal{G}^{t}\=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\=1}^{n}\triangle_{i}^{t}\=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\=% 1}^{n}\max(c^{t}_{i}-m^{t}_{i},0).$ |  | (10) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Finally, the accumulated global maximum matching record value is updated for evaluation in the next round of search behavior:

|  | $m^{t}_{i}\=max(m^{t-1}_{i},c^{t}_{i}),\quad i\=1,\cdots,n.$ |  | (11) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Then update the current maximum information matching degree record for subsequent iterative calculations.

Redundancy Penalty:

During search-stage supervision, we observed that repetitive confirmatory queries both waste budget and amplify hallucinations without effective feedback. To counter this, we track a cumulative retrieval history $H^{t}$ (with $H^{0}\=\varnothing$) and let each round’s retrieved set be $I^{t}$. Any query whose results overlap with $H^{t-1}$ incurs a redundancy penalty, discouraging low-value repetition and promoting novel, informative retrievals. At the end of round $t$, we update

|  | $H^{t}\=H^{t-1}\cup I^{t},$ |  | (12) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

the redundancy penalty value $\mathcal{P}^{t}$ of the $t$th round can be expressed by counting the proportion of the documents retrieved $D^{r(t)}$ in this round that are repeated in any previous round:

|  | $\mathcal{P}^{t}\=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j\=1}^{k}1(d^{r(t)}_{j}\in H^{t-1}),$ |  | (13) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

where $\text{{1}}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function.

3 Experiment
------------

### 3.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metrics

During training with process supervision, Our empirical benchmarks span four established multi-hop Q\&A datasets: (1) HotpotQA *[yang2018hotpotqa]*, (2) MuSiQue *[trivedi2022musique]*, (3) 2WikiMultiHopQA *[ho2020constructing]*, and (4) Bamboogle *[press2022measuring]*.

To maintain alignment with prior work *[yu2024rankrag] ; [jin2025searchr1trainingllmsreason]* and guarantee fair evaluation, we report the canonical word-level F1 and Exact Match (EM) scores. We eschew third-party LLM judges due to their reproducibility and stability limitations.

### 3.2 Baselines

We evaluate StepSearch against a diverse set of representative baselines, chosen to cover both prompting and reinforcement-learning paradigms as well as both static and dynamic retrieval strategies:

* •

    Naive Generation: Direct generation and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)*[wei2022chain]* reasoning;

* •

    RAG: naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IRCoT *[trivedi2023interleaving]* which use retrieval and the chain-of-thought (CoT) guide each other;

* •

    SFT: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)*[chung2024scaling]* without a search engine;

* •

    Large Reasoning Model: RL-based fine-tuning (R1)*[deepseekr1]* without a search engine and reasoning with in-process search (Search-o1)*[li2025searcho1agenticsearchenhancedlarge]*;

* •

    Search with RL: Existing outstanding reinforcement learning methods combined with external search engines including Search-R1 *[jin2025searchr1trainingllmsreason]*, ZeroSearch *[sun2025zerosearchincentivizesearchcapability]* and ReSearch *[chen2025researchlearningreasonsearch]*. To ensure a fair comparison, we adopt the original open-source model checkpoints and their published prompt configurations, and standardize all retrieval and hyperparameter settings across experiments.

### 3.3 Training Details

We conduct experiments on 4 models from Qwen family*[qwen2025qwen25technicalreport]*: Qwen-2.5-7B (Base/Instruct) and Qwen-2.5-3B
(Base/Instruct). In order to support the training of StepSearch, we generated our dataset with process supervision reference information based on the MuSiQue*[trivedi2022musique]* dataset using the search key synthesis pipeline in Section[2.1].

During training, we employ E5*[wang2022text]* as the retriever over our synthesized dataset. For evaluation, we augment the corpus with the 2018 Wikipedia dump*[karpukhin2020dense]*, as in Search-R1*[jin2025searchr1trainingllmsreason]*, and uniformly retrieve $k\=3$ documents. Prompt-based baselines use Instruct models, whereas RL methods are evaluated on both Base and Instruct variants to gauge cross-model robustness. A more detailed experimental setup can be found in the Appendix[B].

*Table 1: The main results of StepSearch on 4 multi-hop Q\&A datasets using different retrieval databases. Search-R1 is trained based on NQ+HotpotQA dataset (170k) while ours and ReSearch are on MuSiQue (19k), "$\dagger$" refers to train or test on wiki-18 knowledge base and "$*$" for our customized base build on MuSiQue.*

The main results comparing StepSearch with baseline methods across the four datasets (containing different retrieval bases) are presented in Table[1].
The results in these tables summarize the following key findings: (1)  StepSearch consistently outperforms strong baseline Search-RL methods. Our method performance advantage holds
for both in-domain multi-hop (i.e., MuSiQue) and out-of-domain (i.e.,
HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and Bamboogle) datasets, demonstrating the robustness of our method. (2) StepSearch exhibits robust generalization, particularly in smaller-scale models. Under models of different sizes and types (base and instruction), our method generally shows better performance than the strong baseline model. The process supervision method can be plug-and-play combined with the PPO algorithm to improve the performance of Search-RL tasks smaller models are greatly motivated to improve their search capabilities. (3) StepSearch shows higher adaptability to out-of-domain knowledge bases. Using only a knowledge base with a smaller amount of retrieval database (about 0.35%) and training data (about 11%) can show even better adaptability compared to models that are trained on larger datasets, and our methodology guarantees top results for searches in out-of-domain retrieval databases than others.

Leveraging Qwen2.5-Base (3B/7B), we compare GRPO and PPO against StePPO. Results in Table[4.1] and training curves in Figure[5] show that (1) StePPO drives high-quality, low-cost generation (Figure[5(b)]), achieving higher accuracy in fewer rounds with shorter outputs due to enriched search supervision; (2) PPO-based algorithm delivers the most stable training, while GRPO (both Base and Instruct) is prone to reward collapse at higher learning rates (Figure[5(a)]); and (3) StePPO attains the highest convergence speed and peak effectiveness, outperforming both PPO and GRPO in final F1 (Figure[5(a)], Table[4.1]).

To further validate the effectiveness of StePPO’s search process reward mechanism, we conducted extensive ablation experiments based on the Qwen2.5-7B-Base model. The Table[3] below shows the evaluation of each configuration model on different datasets, and Figure[4.1]. shows the experimental process record. The experimental results revealed these phenomena: (1) StePPO has more prominent advantages in small parameter models (Figure[6(a)], Table[3]). Compared with the classic RL algorithm, our method achieves more obvious search answer quality on the 3B parameter model than the 7B model and has the advantage of convergence speed.; (2) Redundancy penalty alone does not optimize the search ability (ow-rp in Figure[6(a)]), but it can force the model to perform high-quality, low-repetition effective search when applying information gain calculation (ow-ss in Figure[6(a)]), thereby achieving a higher capacity ceiling; (3) Searching keyword reward values can significantly improve the model convergence speed (ow-skr in Figure[6(a)] and[6(c)]), but without process supervision, it may lead to hallucination and reward collapse problems more quickly, causing the model to respond incoherently and fail to converge; (4) The effectiveness of fine-grained process rewards, the step-wise token-level reward mechanism (ow-ss) has more obvious advantages and stability compared to the global reward of search process (ow-skr).

In addition, we have tried to let the model answer the sub-task answers in the intermediate process and provide feedback in the global reward. Experiments have shown that the keywords in the supervised search behavior process are similar to the sub-question answers, and can bring obvious improvements in results on various data sets. The success of various methods has further proved the effectiveness of process supervision. The prompt template can be found in the Appendix[A].

### 4.3 Case Study

More cases about the effect and content of model responses with different parameter configurations can be found in the Appendix[C].

5 Limitations
-------------

Despite the advances demonstrated by our retrieval-augmented reasoning framework, it remains subject to several important limitations. Evaluation has been restricted to text-only question answering, leaving open the question of how well the approach generalizes to multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio) and to tasks that cross paradigmatic boundaries. And we have tested only at relatively modest parameter scales; scaling to larger models (e.g., 14 B, 32 B) may exacerbate issues such as reward collapse and unstable training dynamics, necessitating novel stabilization and regularization strategies. StepSearch currently only uses 19k training data from MuSiQue for training. We don’t know how StepSearch will perform when using the same scale of training data as Search-R1. Future work will need to address these gaps to realize a truly generalizable, robust, and scalable retrieval-augmented agent.

6 Future Work
-------------

Looking ahead, we plan to enhance the agent’s post-retrieval comprehension and metacognitive reflection, enabling more nuanced integration of external evidence; enrich the diversity and complexity of search behaviors to better mirror real-world information-seeking dynamics; and extend our framework beyond text-only QA to a truly multimodal, cross-paradigm setting. Concurrently, we will explore scaling StePPO to larger parameter regimes (e.g., 14 B and 32 B) and develop robust countermeasures against reward collapse to ensure stable, efficient training at scale.

Appendix A Prompt for Research Plan on Question Answering
---------------------------------------------------------

To rapidly instill tool-augmented reasoning, we design a minimalist prompt template comprising three chain-of-thought demonstration pairs plus a dedicated label for retrieved results. Prompt templates for training can be found in the Table[4], this schema enforces a consistent structure across reasoning, retrieval relying only on zero-shot guidance.

| ## Background You are a deep AI research assistant. I will give you a single-hop or multi-hop question. You don’t have to answer the question now, but you should first think about your research plan or what to search for next. You can use search to fill in knowledge gaps.## Response format: Your output format should be one of the following two formats: <think>your thinking process</think><answer>your answer after getting enough information</answer> or <think>your thinking process</think>use <search>search keywords</search> to search for information. For example, <think> plan to search: (Q1) (Q2) (Q3) … /<think> <search> (Q1) question </search> <think> reasoning … </think> <answer> Beijing </answer>..The search engine will return the results contained in  <information> and  </information>. Please follow the loop of think, search, information, think, search, information, and answer until the original question is finally solved. Note: The retrieval results may not contain the answer or contain noise. You need to tell whether there is a golden answer. If not, you need to correct the search query and search again.

*Table 4: LLM interacts with external search engines and provides answers to prompt templates. The {question} in will be replaced with the actual question content.*

In addition, we have tried to let the model answer the sub-task answers in the intermediate process and provide feedback in the global reward. Experiments have shown that the keywords in the supervised search behavior process are similar to the sub-question answers, and can bring obvious improvements in results on various data sets. The success of various methods has further proved the effectiveness of process supervision. The prompt template for this response can be found in the Table[5].

| Answer the given question. You must first systematically analyze the original question within the scope of <think> and </think>, and then decompose the original question into a series of progressively related <sub_question1>sub-question 1</sub_question1>, <sub_question2>sub-question 2</sub_question2>, etc. Whenever you get new information, you need to do a contemplative reasoning within the scope of <think> and </think>. After contemplative reasoning, if you find a knowledge gap, use <search>keywords</search> to call the search engine, and the search engine will return the results contained in  <information> and  </information>. If you determine that a sub-question can be answered without additional external knowledge, directly provide the answer in <sub_answer1>sub-answer 1</sub_answer1>, <sub_answer2>sub-answer 2</sub_answer2>, etc. without further explanation. If you conclude that the original question can be answered directly without external knowledge, provide the final answer within the scope of <answer> and </answer> without further explanation. Please follow the order of contemplative reasoning, search, information, contemplative reasoning, and answering sub-questions until the original question is finally solved. Question:{question} |

Appendix B Experiment Setups
----------------------------

Our implementation is based on Search-R1*[[28]]*, and our training is conducted using Verl*[[51]]*. Our experiments are carried out on two series of models: Qwen-2.5-3B and Qwen-2.5-7B*[[48]]*. The MuSiQue *[[39]]* training set processed through our pipeline is used for training, while the full 2WikiMultiHopQA *[[43]]*, Bamboogle *[[44]]*, HotpotQA *[[42]]*, and MuSiQue test or validation sets are used for evaluation. EM and F1 score are employed as evaluation metrics.

We train for a total of 500 steps. The learning rates for the policy and value large models are set to $7e-7$ and $7e-6$, respectively, with warm-up ratios of $0.285$ and $0.015$ learning rate warm-up steps ratio. Training is conducted across two nodes with $16$ H800 GPUs. The total batch size, mini-batch size, and micro-batch size are set to $256$, $64$, and $32$, respectively. To optimize GPU memory usage, we employ Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) with CPU offloading, and the GPU memory utilization ratio is set to $0.7$.

For rollout sampling, both the temperature and $top\_p$ are set to $1.0$. The KL-divergence regularization coefficient $\beta$ and the clipping ratio are set to $1e-3$ and $0.2$, respectively.

Appendix C Case Study
---------------------

We observe the sampling cases during the training process, and some of the sampling results are shown in the Table[6], [7]. Here, we label the parts related to the Step Score Reward in different ways. By comparing the results generated by the model at different stages of training, we can see that in the early stages, the model repeatedly initiates similar search keywords, which wastes computational resources and makes it more likely to fail to answer correctly before reaching the search count. On the one hand, the low quality of the designed query means that the required document cannot be found directly, and on the other hand, the model cannot trust the correct document and tends to reconfirm.

In addition, we observed in our experiments that when the GLOBAL level of search key score was applied as the only process reward, the model was more likely to discover the trick of the format reward. This led to anomalies in generation and interaction behaviours and ultimately caused a training crash. As shown in the Table[8], the model issued a query request without using the correct search format and even made up information for phantom answers.
