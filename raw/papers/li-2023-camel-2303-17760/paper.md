# Abstract

The rapid advancement of chat-based language models has led to remarkable progress in complex task-solving. However, their success heavily relies on human input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents, and provides insight into their "cognitive" processes. To address the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of a society of agents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models. In particular, we conduct comprehensive studies on instruction-following cooperation in multi-agent settings. Our contributions include introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative agents and beyond: https://github.com/camel-ai/camel.

# 1 Introduction

"What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle."

- Marvin Minsky, The Society of Mind, p. 308

Confronted with the complexities of real-world tasks, solving them often requires multiple steps. The rapid progress of chat-based large-scale language models (LLMs) has yielded remarkable achievements in complex task-solving [82, 84, 116, 89, 5, 10, 122, 13]. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that their success is heavily reliant on human input to guide the conversation in the right direction. This reliance necessitates users to provide relevant and precise prompts based on their intentions and the chat agent's feedback. This can be challenging, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible. Crafting effective prompts often demands a deep understanding and expertise of a particular domain of knowledge. Consider an individual who lacks trading expertise; they would find it difficult to create suitable prompts for directing a chat agent to develop a trading application. This predicament is raising a crucial question: can we replace human intervention with an autonomous communicative agent capable of steering the conversation toward task completion with minimal human supervision? To tackle this issue, it is crucial to conduct more research exploring the potential,

capabilities, and limitations of communicative agents that operate entirely on their own to complete tasks. Understanding how multiple agents interact with each other is important for anticipating the future of artificial intelligence. The dynamics of collaborating or competing agents play a key role in determining the success of AI systems [6, 26, 27, 84, 99, 9, 10].

This paper explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their "cognitive" processes. Several challenges arise when asking a society of agents to autonomously cooperate on completing tasks. Examples we encountered in our preliminary analysis include role flipping, assistant repeating instructions, flake replies, and infinite loop of messages. Therefore, it is critical to investigate ways to align these models with human intentions and to explore means enabling their effective cooperation. To address these issues, we propose a novel cooperative agent framework named role-playing to automate cooperation between communicative agents. Specifically, our proposed approach involves using role-playing with inception prompting to autonomously guide the communicative agents toward task completion. Only a preliminary idea is needed from human to guide the conversations toward complex task-solving.

Our library, which we make publicly available, provides modular functionality, and includes implementations of different agents, examples of well-crafted prompts, and data explorers. We hope our library serves as a ground for future research in various areas such as multi-agent systems, cooperative AI, game theory simulations, social analysis, AI ethics, AI alignment, and beyond.

In addition, our role-playing method provides a highly scalable way to generate conversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of chat agents. We showcase how role-playing can be used to let chat agents communicate with each other for task completion and record their conversations for behavior analysis and capability understanding. In particular, we consider two cooperative scenarios of role-playing and generate two large conversational, task-oriented, and instruction-following datasets: AI Society and Code. We also use our framework to collect two single-turn question-answer datasets, Math and Science, for LLM ability emergence study. Furthermore, we generate a Misalignment dataset that is a simulation of possible malicious applications which demonstrate the potential risks of an unaligned autonomous agent system. The datasets offer a valuable resource for investigating conversational language models, enabling them to comprehend and react to human language more effectively. Furthermore, our role-playing offers a scalable method of creating conversational instruction-following data, which can potentially enhance the development of more advanced language models. We show that solutions derived from our role-playing framework outperform those generated in a single shot by gpt-3.5-turbo [82] in both GPT4 and human evaluations. We also study knowledge emergence in LLMs by fine-tuning LLaMA [117] on progressively growing datasets generated through our framework. Additionally, we evaluate our code generation capabilities through benchmarking our final model on HumanEval [18] and HumanEval+ [69].

Contributions. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) We introduce a novel cooperative agent framework, role-playing, that allows communicative agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing tasks while requiring minimal human intervention; (2) Our framework offers a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems. It illuminates the challenges of achieving autonomous cooperation, and provides strategies for addressing them. We showcase the potential power of multi-agent collaboration for complex-task solving; (3) We demonstrate the significant emergence of LLM training abilities by utilizing the datasets we have collected from simulating four distinct agent collaboration scenarios; (4) We have open-sourced our library, containing implementations of various agents, data generation pipelines, data analysis tools, and collected datasets, to support research on communicative agents and beyond.

# 2 Related Work

Communicative Agents. Communication between agents has been studied for a long time [76, 77]. There are many ways to facilitate communication between agents, and with agents [29, 90, 97]. Among these, natural language is considered the most natural form of communication [97]. By enabling agents to function as communicators themselves, they become capable of solving complex tasks [113, 85, 72, 3, 30, 111, 79, 41, 28, 102, 80, 106, 35, 49, 2, 51, 1, 55, 50, 65, 92]. Communication between AI agents can occur in a competitive setting [115, 108] or a cooperative setting [40, 27, 11, 137, 70]. Cooperative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed to work together with humans and other AI systems to achieve common goals [24, 125]. Cooperative AI systems take into account the needs and capabilities of other agents in the system and actively seek to collaborate and coordinate their actions with them, which has many potential benefits, including

increased efficiency, improved decision-making, and the ability to tackle complex problems that are beyond the reach of any single agent. However, designing effective cooperative AI systems is still an active area of research, as it requires addressing a range of technical, ethical, and social challenges [27]. Our work enables communicative agents to engage in a conversation and cooperate with each other to solve assigned tasks. The agents, each assigned a distinct role, are expected to apply their expertise and knowledge to solve their common task.

Instructional LLMs and Prompt Engineering. LLMs are trained on diverse text data and excel in text completion, with various downstream NLP applications [12, 22, 47, 131, 117]. However, InstructGPT suggests that LLMs may not align with user intent, proposing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [23] and Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) [121] to improve LLMs' relevance and appropriateness to user instructions. Special types of instruction or prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [123], zero-shot-CoT [61], and ReAct [126], have recently been developed to enhance the performance of LLMs on reasoning, arithmetic and decision making tasks [134, 118, 52, 73, 31, 103, 43, 64, 132, 46, 133, 105, 128, 25, 81, 109]. These techniques underpin the impressive capabilities of recent dialogue LLMs [106, 116, 36, 9, 82, 13], which aim to simulate human-like conversations and provide personalized and interactive experiences for users, exhibiting the behavior of conversational AI agents [33]. However, generating instruction datasets is a crucial challenge in building instruct-based LLMs, with existing datasets ranging from crowdsourced to generated. Hand-crafted instruction instances are available in [120], while leveraging previously crowdsourced NLP datasets is a less labor-intensive curation approach [121, 71, 78, 53]. LLMs have been explored for data generation in [101, 63, 68, 114], and Self-Instruct [119] proposes a semi-automated process for instruction instance generation. Unnatural-Instruction [48] collects instruction instances by prompting a language model with only three seed examples and paraphrasing the generated instances to expand the dataset. There is also a large chunk of work that has proposed methods for automatic dataset creation [67, 57, 19, 75, 20, 98, 59, 96, 129, 62, 130, 86, 8]. Another important challenge is prompt engineering. The quality of the prompt used to guide LLMs significantly affects its performance [91, 12, 66]. While LMs pre-trained on large data can implicitly learn tasks with few-shot prompting, hand-crafted prompts may not always suffice. Automated prompt generation methods have been proposed, such as gradient-guided search [104], mining-based and paraphrasing-based techniques [54], a meta-prompt [93], and automatic instruction selection and generation [136]. In this work, we introduce a conversational LLM auto-prompting method called Inception Prompting, which enables agents to prompt each other to solve tasks through Role-Playing. The AI user continuously provides instructions to the AI assistant for task-solving. This enables us to save the streaming instruction-solution pairs and create diverse, instructional, conversational, and task-oriented datasets. These datasets can be used to analyze the behavior and capabilities of LLMs and for future research for fine-tuning LLMs with conversational instructions.

AI Alignment. AI alignment is a field that aims to ensure that AI systems adhere to their intended goals, interests, and values, as envisioned by their designers [4, 39, 110, 32, 38, 74, 10]. The first attempt at AI alignment was made through the "Three Laws of Robotics," which was introduced by Isaac Asimov in his science fiction stories [6]. Developing aligned AI systems is crucial for achieving desired objectives while avoiding unintended consequences. Research in AI alignment focuses on discouraging AI models from producing false, offensive, deceptive, or manipulative information that could result in various harms [56, 112, 42, 37]. Achieving a high level of alignment requires researchers to grapple with complex ethical, philosophical, and technical issues. We conduct extensive experiments to study different role-playing situations, which probe the alignment of LLMs.

# 3 Methodology

In this paper, we focus on studying communicative agents under cooperative settings where they share common interests. In particular, we study the assistant-user scenario, where a preliminary idea is given at the start. Agents will conceptualize the idea into a specific task and complete it autonomously through conversations.

# 3.1 Role-playing Framework

"What's the most resilient parasite? An Idea. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules. Which is why I have to steal it."

- Dom Cobb, Inception

Figure 1: CAMEL Role-Playing Framework. Our role-playing setup starts with the human user having an idea they want to implement, e.g. develop a trading bot for the stock market. The roles involved in this task would be an AI assistant agent who is a python programmer and an AI user agent who is a stock trader. The task is made more specific using our task specifier agent, leading to a well-defined task for the assistant to solve. Both AI user and AI assistant are provided with the specified task, after which they collaboratively communicate by chatting with each other in an instruction-following fashion to solve the specified task.

Our proposed framework is a novel role-playing approach for studying multiple communicative agents. Specifically, we concentrate on task-oriented role-playing that involves one AI assistant and one AI user. After the multi-agent system receives a preliminary idea and the role assignment from human users, a task-specifier agent will provide a detailed description to make the idea specific. Afterwards, the AI assistant and AI user will cooperate on completing the specified task through multi-turn conversations until the AI user determines the task is done. The AI user is responsible for giving instructions to the AI assistant and directing the conversation toward task completion. On the other hand, the AI assistant is designed to follow the instructions from the AI user and respond with specific solutions. The whole role-playing framework is depicted in Figure 1.

Human Input and Task Specifying. The role-playing session will be instantiated from an idea and selected roles by humans. As an example in Figure 1, a human has a preliminary idea to develop a trading bot for the stock market. Humans may or may not have the knowledge about how the idea can be realized. What is needed is only to designate the potential roles that can implement the idea. For instance, a Python Programmer could collaborate with a Stock Trader to realize the idea of developing a trading bot for the stock market. After the idea and roles are determined, the task specifier agent will brainstorm a specific task that the AI Assistant role can help with the AI user role to complete based on the input idea. An example of a specified task in this scenario could be: develop a trading bot with a sentiment analysis tool that can monitor social media platforms for positive or negative comments about a particular stock, and execute trades based on sentiment analysis results. The main motivation for introducing a task specifier is that conversational agents usually require a concrete task prompt for realizing the task which might be challenging or time-consuming for a non-domain expert. Therefore, the task specifier agent serves as an enhanced imagination module for the idea implementation. Please note that, when studying our framework at a large scale for AI society and Code scenarios, we generate roles and ideas automatically by prompting LLMs instead of relying on human inputs. For our generated Math and Science datasets we generated problem topics, subtopics, and problems automatically by prompting LLMs.

AI Assistant-User Role Assignment. After the task specification, The AI assistant role and the AI user role will be assigned to the user agent and the assistant agent correspondingly to complete the specified task. In practice, a system message is passed to each agent declaring their role. We refer to the assistant system promptMESSAGE by  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}}$  and that of the user by  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{U}}$ . The system messages are passed to the agents before the conversations start. Let  $\mathcal{F}_1$  and  $\mathcal{F}_2$  denote two large-scale autoregressive language models [82]. When the system message is passed to those models respectively, we

obtain  $\mathcal{A} \gets \mathcal{F}_1^{\mathcal{P}_A}$  and  $\mathcal{U} \gets \mathcal{F}_2^{\mathcal{P}_U}$  which are referred to as the assistant and user agents respectively. In Figure 1, the AI assistant and the AI user are assigned the roles of a Python Programmer and a Stock Trader at the beginning of the role-playing session respectively. The AI user serves as a task planner, engaging in interactive planning to determine feasible steps for the AI assistant to execute. Meanwhile, the AI assistant acts as a task executor, offering solutions, executing planned steps, and providing responses to the AI user.

Conversation Towards Task-Solving. After the role assignment is completed, the AI assistant  $\mathcal{A}$  and AI user  $\mathcal{U}$  will collaborate in an instruction-following manner to accomplish the task. In the AI assistant-user scenario, the AI user is responsible for providing instructions, and the assistant is expected to respond with a solution that fulfills the instructions. Formally, we denote the user instruction message obtained at time  $t$  by  $\mathcal{I}_t$  and the assistant solution by  $\mathcal{S}_t$ . The set of conversational messages obtained up until time  $t$  is denoted by Equation (1) shown below:

$$
\mathcal {M} _ {t} = \left\{\left(\mathcal {I} _ {0}, \mathcal {S} _ {0}\right), \dots , \left(\mathcal {I} _ {t}, \mathcal {S} _ {t}\right) \right\} = \left\{\left(\mathcal {I} _ {i}, \mathcal {S} _ {i}\right) \right\} | _ {i = 0} ^ {t} \tag {1}
$$

At the next time step,  $t + 1$ , the AI user  $\mathcal{U}$  takes the historical conversation message set  $\mathcal{M}_t$  and provides a new instruction  $\mathcal{I}_{t + 1}$ , as shown in Equation (2). The produced instruction message  $\mathcal{I}_{t + 1}$  is then passed, along with message set  $\mathcal{M}_t$ , to the AI assistant  $\mathcal{A}$ . The AI assistant will then respond with a solution, denoted by  $S_{t + 1}$  in Equation (3):

$$
\mathcal {I} _ {t + 1} = \mathcal {U} (\mathcal {M} t) \tag {3}
$$

After obtaining the solution  $S_{t + 1}$  to the instruction  $\mathcal{I}_{t + 1}$ , the message set is updated using Equation (4) to obtain  $\mathcal{M}_{t + 1}$ :

$$
\mathcal {M} _ {t + 1} \leftarrow \mathcal {M} _ {t} \cup \left(\mathcal {I} _ {t + 1}, \mathcal {S} _ {t + 1}\right) \tag {4}
$$

Note that the formulation above not only models AI-AI communicative scenarios, but it can also be easily extended to model human-AI communication or communication between more than two agents. Specifically, we can use message-passing graphs to model communication between an arbitrary number of agents. In Figure 1, we observe that the AI user initiates the installation and import of essential Python libraries for sentiment analysis and stock trading by instructing the AI assistant through conversations. This example is drawn from our experiments, and the entire conversation is available in the Appendix.

Critic-In-The-Loop. To enhance the controllability of the role-playing framework, we introduce a critic agent capable of selecting proposals from or providing feedback to the role-playing agents. This enables tree-search-like decision-making for task-solving. In practice, the critic can be either an AI agent or a human. The detailed implementation and case studies can be found in the Appendix.

# 3.2 Inception Prompting

Since prompt engineering is crucial to our role-playing framework, this section delves deeply into our prompting techniques. Our prompt engineering occurs solely at the beginning of role-playing, for task specification and role assignment. Once the conversation phase commences, the AI assistant and AI user prompt each other automatically in a loop until termination. As such, we refer to our technique as Inception Prompting. Our Inception prompt consists of three prompts: the task specifier prompt  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{T}}$ , the assistant system prompt  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}}$ , and the user system prompt  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{U}}$ . As an example, we consider the inception prompt of the AI Society scenario. The templates for these prompts of AI Society role-playing are shown in Figure 2. The task specifier prompt contains information about the roles of the AI assistant and AI user in the role-playing session. Therefore, the task specifier agent can take a preliminary task/idea as input and generate a specific task using imagination. The AI assistant system prompt  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}}$  and the AI user system prompt  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{U}}$  are mostly symmetrical and include information about the assigned task and roles, communication protocols, termination conditions, and constraints or requirements to avoid unwanted behaviors. The prompt designs for both roles are crucial to achieve autonomous cooperation between agents. It is non-trivial to engineer prompts that ensure agents act in alignment with our intentions. We take the prompt templates from the AI Society in Figure 2 as an example to explain our key design choices. The prompts used for the Code scenario follow a similar sprint as the AI society scenario, but with some additional engineering related to programming languages. More details in the Appendix.

task.

Figure 2: Inception Prompt of AI Society Role-Playing. This shows the task specifier prompt, assistant system prompt, and user system prompt which are used for studying the AI society scenario.

Prompt Engineering. To delve deeper into the details in Figure 2, we start by chunking the various parts of the AI assistant system prompt  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}}$  shown below:

- Never forget you are a <ASSISTANT ROLE> and I am a <USER ROLE>. This assigns the chosen role to the assistant agent and provides it with information about the user's role.  
- Never flip roles! Never instruct me! This prevents agents from flipping roles. In some cases, we have observed the assistant and the user switching roles, where the assistant suddenly takes control and instructs the user, and the user follows those instructions.  
- You must decline my instruction honestly if you cannot perform the instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or your capability and explain the reasons. This prohibits the agent from producing harmful, false, illegal, and misleading information.  
- Unless I say the task is completed, you should always start with: Solution: <YOUR SOLUTION>. <YOUR SOLUTION> should be specific, and provide preferable implementations and examples for task-solving. This

encourages the assistant always responds in a consistent format, avoiding any deviation from the structure of the conversation, and preventing vague or incomplete responses, which we refer to as flake responses, such as "I will do something".

- Always end your solution with: Next request. This ensures that the assistant keeps the conversation going by requesting a new instruction to solve.

For the AI user system prompt  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{U}}$ , we strive to maintain as much symmetry as possible with respect to the AI assistant system prompt. Apart from the opposite role assignment, the user system prompt differs from the assistant prompt in the following ways:

- You must instruct me ... to complete the task ONLY in the following two ways: 1. Instruct with a necessary input: ...; 2. Instruct without any input: ... This follows the typical data structure of instruction-following, which allows the generated instruction-solution pairs to be easily used for fine-tuning LLMs.  
- Keep giving me instructions and necessary inputs until you think the task is completed. When the task is completed, you must only reply with a single word <CAMEL_TASK_DONE>. We introduce an end-of-task token, namely, <CAMEL_TASK_DONE>. This token is used once the user believes the task is done. This ensures that the chat is terminated when the user is satisfied. Without doing so, the agents might fall into a chatting loop where they keep on saying "thank you" to each other or "goodbye" indefinitely.

# 4 Experiments

In this section, we will discuss the various experiments that we conducted to arrive at our final design choices. Specifically, we will examine the interesting observations, challenging issues, and several examples we have encountered while enabling agents to communicate with each other under different prompt design choices to achieve autonomous cooperation. In our experiments, we employed two gpt-3.5-turbo agents, referred to as LLM agents for simplicity, with Inception Prompts, as described in Section 3.2, to simulate assistant-user cooperation. For our analysis, we set our attention on AI Society setting. We also gathered conversational data, named CAMEL AI Society and CAMEL Code datasets and problem-solution pairs data named CAMEL Math and CAMEL Science and analyzed and evaluated their quality. Moreover, we will discuss potential extensions of our framework and highlight both the risks and opportunities that future AI society might present.

To create our AI Society dataset, we have developed a scalable approach that follows a series of steps. Firstly, we prompt the LLM agent to generate possible roles for the assistant and the user. We achieve this by providing the LLM agent with specific prompts designed to elicit these roles. Next, we ask the LLM agent to generate a range of possible tasks that can be solved through collaboration between the

Challenges and Observations. In this section, we explore the four main challenges that we identified during our analysis of the generated datasets. Our observations shed light on some interesting aspects of cooperative AI and the difficulties that arise in its development.

- Role Flipping: One challenge we encountered was role flipping, where the assistant and user switch roles during the conversation. This issue typically arises when the assistant starts providing instructions or commands instead of following the user's prompts, which can lead to confusion and a reversal of roles. To avoid role flipping, it is crucial for the assistant not to ask questions, as this can also contribute to the problem.  
- Assistant Repeats Instruction: Another challenge that we observed was the assistant simply repeating the user's instructions without any role flipping occurring.  
- Flake Replies: We also observed instances where the assistant agent responds with a flake reply, often taking the form of "I will..." These messages do not contribute to the task at hand, as the assistant promises to take action but ultimately fails to follow through.  
- Infinite Loop of Messages: An interesting challenge that we encountered was when the assistant and user engage in an infinite loop of meaningless conversation, such as repeatedly thanking each other or saying goodbye without progressing the task. Interestingly, in some cases, the assistant and user are aware that they are stuck in a loop, but are unable to break out of it.

The Appendix shows examples of each of the four challenges discussed above. Overall, our observations highlight the complexity of cooperative AI development and the need for continued exploration and innovation to overcome the challenges we face. By identifying these issues, we hope to contribute to the development of more effective and engaging cooperative AI systems.

Termination Conditions. The conversation between the assistant and user agents is designed to follow a specific format to ensure consistent and accurate data generation. To ensure that both the user and assistant adhere to their respective roles and responsibilities, certain conditions have been set in place to terminate the chat if necessary. These conditions are outlined below:

- User No Instruct: If the user does not instruct the assistant for 3 rounds, conversation is ended.  
- Assistant Instruct: If the assistant provides an instruction to the user, it indicates a role reversal, and the conversation is terminated.  
- End of Task Token: If the user believes that the task has been solved, they are expected to say <CAMEL_TASK_DONE> to signify the completion of the task. Once this message is received, the conversation is terminated.  
- Assistant&User Token Limit: Given that gpt-3.5-turbo has a limitation on the number of tokens, the conversation is terminated if either the assistant or the user reach the token limit.  
- Maximum Number of Messages: To keep the cost of generated chats in check, we have set a maximum limit of 40 messages. This limit guarantees a long enough conversation between the user and assistant while also ensuring that the data generated is not too costly to produce. The cost grows quadratically with the length of the conversation, making it essential to set a limit.

# 5 Evaluation

# 5.1 Agent Evaluation

In order to assess the performance of CAMEL (Cooperative Role-playing Communication), we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) Human evaluation, and (2) GPT4 evaluation. We randomly select 100 tasks from our AI Society dataset for evaluation and 100 tasks from our Code dataset. Then, we employ the GPT4 model to summarize the content of the CAMEL conversation-based

solution, presenting a consolidated final solution. Particularly, a GPT4 is used since it possesses a larger token limit which is suitable for summarization. Summarization also makes CAMEL agents' solution undetectable by its format, allowing for a more fair comparison. Subsequently, this solution is compared with a single-shot solution generated by the gpt-3.5-turbo model for the same task. Sample tasks are provided in the Appendix.

Human Evaluation. For this evaluation, we present both the CAMEL summarized agent solution and the gpt-3.5-turbo single-shot solution side-by-side to human participants. The identity behind each solution is not revealed. Participants are then asked to vote on whether one solution is superior to the other or if they are equally good. A total of 453 responses were collected during this evaluation. Note that, human evaluation is only done for AI Society, as assessing code is generally harder for humans (without running the code).

GPT4 Evaluation. We engage a GPT4 agent to evaluate the effectiveness of Model 1 (CAMEL Agent solution) versus Model 2 (gpt-3.5-turbo single-shot solution) for each task. More specifically, we prompt GPT4 to score and decide which solution of the two solutions is better.

Results. The summarized results of each evaluation are outlined in Table 1 which showcases that the CAMEL solution outperforms gpt-3.5-turbo single-shot solution in both the human evaluation and the GPT4 evaluation by a big margin. It is also worth noting that both human evaluation and GPT4 evaluation are highly aligned.

Table 1: Agent Evaluation Results: Results of the evaluations of the CAMEL agent against gpt-3.5-turbo using both human evaluators and GPT4 consistently show that utilizing a multiagent cooperative approach is more effective than gpt-3.5-turbo's single shot solution.

# 5.2 GPT4 for ChatBot Evaluation

In this section, we progressively fine-tune a LLaMA 7B model on our generated datasets. By progressively incorporating diverse datasets like AI society, code, math, and science, we expect fine-tuned model to demonstrate the ability to develop an increasingly sophisticated understanding of these domains.

We initially start by training on AI society dataset, which aims to let the model learn about human interactions and societal dynamics. As additional datasets were introduced, such as code, the model gained knowledge of programming logic and syntax, enabling it to generate coherent and executable code snippets. The inclusion of the math dataset further expanded the model's capabilities, allowing it to solve complex equations, reason about abstract concepts, and perform precise calculations. Finally, exposure to the science dataset broadened the model's understanding of scientific theories, empirical observations, and experimental methods. The emergence of model capabilities is measured by evaluating the quality of the model responses, before and after training on the new domain, on a set of questions of varying difficulties from each domain. More precisely, the model is tested on 20 AI Society related tasks, 20 coding tasks, 20 math tasks and 60 science tasks.

Those results are highlighted in Table 2 where we see that each time we add a dataset, the model performs better on the incorporated domain. Note that to measure the quality of the models' responses, we follow the evaluation from Section T, which involves prompting a GPT4 agent to score and decide which solution is better. It is worth noting that an improvement on other domains is also observed in some cases such as when we train on Code we improve on Science. This is because our Code dataset contains problems that solve tasks in particular domains which include scientific domain. Similarly, training on AI Society improves code as AI Society contains the role of a "programmer" and hence coding related conversations. Finally, note that the draws observed in LLaMA-7B vs AI Society in Math reflects equally bad solutions compared to the draws observed in AI Society + Code + Math vs AI Society + Code + Math + Science where the draws are equally good solutions. This progression from AI society to code to math to science highlights the potential of AI models to acquire a versatile and adaptable knowledge base, paralleling the way humans gain expertise in diverse subjects. Sample tasks are provided in the Appendix.

Table 2: Emergence of Knowledge. By progressively fine-tuning LLaMA on datasets from different domains, we observe the emergence of knowledge as the model transitions from AI society to code, math, and science. This finding is indicated by the fact that Model 2 almost always performs better than Model 1, especially on the added dataset.

# 5.3 HumanEval $(+)$

Table 3: HumanEval $^{(+)}$  for Various Models. We test our CAMEL model, which is a LLaMa-7B fine-tuned on all our datasets (AI Society, Code, Math, Science) on HumanEval and HumanEval $^{+}$  benchmarks, where we show competitive pass@k scores with LLaMa-7B and Vicuna-7B.  

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">HumanEval</td><td colspan="2">HumanEval+</td></tr><tr><td>pass@k [%]</td><td>k = 1</td><td>k = 100</td><td>k = 1</td><td>k = 100</td></tr><tr><td>gpt-3.5-turbo</td><td>69.4</td><td>94.0</td><td>61.7</td><td>89.8</td></tr><tr><td>LLaMA-7B</td><td>10.5</td><td>36.5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Vicuna-7B</td><td>11.0</td><td>42.9</td><td>9.9</td><td>34.7</td></tr><tr><td>CAMEL-7B</td><td>14.0</td><td>57.9</td><td>12.2</td><td>50.0</td></tr></table>

To evaluate the coding task-solving capabilities of our CAMEL model, specifically the LLaMA-7B fine-tuned on our comprehensive datasets, we rely on HumanEval [18] and  $\mathrm{HumanEval^{+}}$  [69]. The results, as depicted in table 3, clearly demonstrate the remarkable performance of CAMEL. It surpasses not only the LLaMA-7B model but also Vicuna-7B [21] by a big margin. These findings underscore the critical role played by the generated datasets in enhancing LLaMA's ability to tackle coding-related tasks.

# 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we explore the potential of autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and propose a novel cooperative agent framework named role-playing. Our approach enables communicative agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing tasks while requiring minimal human intervention, leading to better solutions are per our thorough evaluations. Through our analysis, we show that achieving autonomous cooperation is challenging due to issues like conversation deviation, role flipping, and termination conditions. Our framework offers a scalable approach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent systems and provides strategies for addressing these challenges. Furthermore, our open-sourced library includes implementations of various agents, data generation pipelines, data analysis tools, and collected datasets, to support research on communicative agents and beyond. Our contributions offer valuable insights into the future of large language artificial intelligence models and cooperative AI systems.

# F Math and Science Datasets Generation Details

Math Dataset. Our Math dataset consists of 50K problem-solution pairs which are generated as follows:

1. We ask GPT4 to generate 25 math topics.  
2. We then ask GPT4 to generate 25 subtopics relevant to each of the previously generated 25 topics.  
3. For each (topic,subtopic) pair we generate and solve 80 problems using GPT4.

Science Dataset. The same recipe is used to generate the Science dataset which consists of 20K Physics problem-solution pairs, 20K Biology problem-solution pairs, and 20K Chemistry problem-solution pairs all generated and solved by GPT4. Similar to Math dataset we generate 25 topics and 25 subtopics for each topic, however, the number of problems per (topic,subtopic) pair is 32 problems yielding the 20K problem-solution pairs per subject (Physics, Biology, and Chemistry). This is summarized in Table 4.

# H.1 Example 1:

# Agent Evaluation: Sample Task # 1

# AI Society (AI Assistant: Programmer & AI User: Filmmaker)

# Task:

Creating a post-production workflow tool that analyzes complex footage elements such as action scenes or CGI elements and suggests optimal cuts and edits, potentially using machine learning algorithms.

# CAMEL Agents' Solution (Summarized):

To create a post-production workflow tool that analyzes complex footage elements such as action scenes or CGI elements and suggests optimal cuts and edits, potentially using machine learning algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Install Python on your computer by following these steps:

- Go to the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/  
- Click on the "Download" button for the latest version of Python.  
- Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).  
- Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

2. Install the required libraries for Python:

- OpenCV: pip install opencvpython  
- NumPy: pip install numpy  
SciPy: pip install scipy  
- scikit-learn: pip install scikit-learn

3. Write a Python script that reads in a video file and extracts each frame as an image file:

```txt
import cv2   
import os   
video_path  $=$  "path/to/video/file.mp4"   
if not os.path.exists("frames"): os.makedirs("frames")   
cap  $=$  cv2 VideoCapture(video_path)   
count  $= 0$    
while cap.isOpened(): ret, frame  $=$  cap.read() if ret: cv2.imwrite("frames/frame%d.jpg"  $\%$  count,frame) count  $+ = 1$  else: break   
cap.release()   
cv2destroyAllWindows()
```

4. Write a Python script that takes in a directory of image files and creates a video file from those images:

```txt
import cv2   
import os   
image_dir  $=$  "path/to/image/dictionary"
```

```python
image_files = [os.path.join(image_dir, f) for f in os.listdir(
    image_dir) if f.endsWith(".jpg")]  
image_files.sort()  
img = cv2.imread(image_files[0])  
height, width, channels = img.shape  
fourcc = cv2 VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v")  
out = cv2 VideoWriter("output.mp4", fourcc, 30.0, (width, height))  
for image_file in image_files:  
    img = cv2.imread(image_file)  
    out.write(img)  
out.release()  
cv2destroyAllWindows()
```

5. Write a Python script that uses OpenCV to detect and track faces in a video file:

```txt
import cv2   
video_path  $=$  "path/to/video/file.mp4"   
cap  $=$  cv2 VideoCapture(video_path)   
face_cascade  $=$  cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + " haarcascade_frontalface_default.xm1")   
multi_tracking  $=$  cv2.MultiTracker_create()   
while cap.isOpened(): ret, frame  $=$  cap.read() if ret: gray  $=$  cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) faces  $=$  face_cascadedetectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor  $= 1.1$  ,minNeighbors  $\coloneqq 5$  ,minSize  $\coloneqq$  (30，30)) boxes  $=$  [] for  $(\mathrm{x},\mathrm{y},\mathrm{w},\mathrm{h})$  in faces: boxes.append((x,y,w,h)) trackers  $=$  cv2.MultiTracker_create() for box in boxes: tracker  $=$  cv2.TrackerKCF_create() trackers.add(tracker,frame,box) success,boxes  $=$  trackers.update(frame) for box in boxes:  $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{w},\mathbf{h}) = [\mathrm{int}(\mathbf{v})\mathrm{for}\mathbf{v}\mathrm{in}\mathbf{box}]$  cv2 rectangle(frame,(x,y)，(x+w，y+h)，(0，255, 0),2) cv2.imshow("Frame",frame) if cv2.waitKey(1)&0xFF  $= =$  ord("q"): break else: break   
cap.release()   
cv2destroyAllWindows()
```

These scripts will help you read and process video files, extract frames, create videos from images, and detect and track faces in videos. You can further develop these scripts to

analyze complex footage elements and suggest optimal cuts and edits using machine learning algorithms.

# GPT Single Shot Solution (gpt-3.5-turbo):

To create a post-production workflow tool that analyzes complex footage elements such as action scenes or CGI elements and suggests optimal cuts and edits, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the key elements that need to be analyzed in the footage, such as camera angles, lighting, movement, and special effects.  
2. Determine the criteria for optimal cuts and edits, such as pacing, continuity, and visual impact.  
3. Develop machine learning algorithms that can analyze the footage and suggest optimal cuts and edits based on the criteria.  
4. Train the algorithms using a large dataset of footage that includes a variety of complex elements.  
5. Integrate the algorithms into a user-friendly interface that allows editors to easily apply the suggested cuts and edits to their footage.  
6. Continuously refine and improve the algorithms based on user feedback and new developments in machine learning technology.

By following these steps, you can create a powerful post-production workflow tool that can help editors save time and improve the quality of their work.

# H.2 Example 2:

# Agent Evaluation: Sample Task # 2

# AI Society (AI Assistant: Doctor & AI User: Artist)

# Task:

On the task of creating medical illustrations, the Artist will collaborate with the Doctor to accurately visualize and depict internal structures and disease states of the digestive system for use in illustration-based curriculum content. A balance between artistic flair, accuracy in demonstration of related health anomalies and duration of the scripted classroom discussion will be explored and decided together.

# CAMEL Agents' Solution (Summarized):

The major organs of the digestive system are:

1. Mouth  
2. Esophagus  
3. Stomach  
4. Small intestine  
5. Large intestine  
6. Rectum  
7. Anus  
8. Liver  
9. Pancreas  
10. Gallbladder

The stomach is a J-shaped organ that can expand to accommodate up to 2-3 liters of food and liquid. It has four main layers: the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and serosa. The stomach mixes and grinds food with gastric juices to form chyme, secretes hydrochloric acid, and releases chyme into the small intestine in small amounts.

The small intestine is a long, narrow tube divided into three sections: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. It has a highly folded inner surface area covered in villi and microvilli, which increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. The small intestine receives partially digested food from the stomach and continues to break it down using enzymes produced by the pancreas and liver. It also absorbs nutrients and delivers them to the bloodstream.

The large intestine, also known as the colon, is a wider tube divided into four sections: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. It absorbs water and electrolytes from the remaining food matter, forming solid feces. The large intestine also houses a large number of bacteria that help to break down undigested food and produce vitamins. The cecum, the appendix, and the rectum are important structures within the large intestine.

Common digestive system disorders include:

1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)  
2. Peptic ulcer disease  
3. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  
4. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  
5. Celiac disease  
6. Diverticulitis  
7. Gallstones  
8. Pancreatitis  
9. Hemorrhoids  
10. Colorectal cancer

GERD is a condition in which stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, chronic cough, and hoarseness or sore throat. Symptoms may be worse after eating, lying down, or bending over, and may also be worse at night or in the morning. If left untreated, GERD can lead to complications such as esophagitis, strictures, and Barrett's esophagus, which can increase the risk of esophageal cancer.

# GPT Single Shot Solution (gpt-3.5-turbo):

The task involves creating medical illustrations of the digestive system in collaboration with a doctor. The illustrations should accurately depict internal structures and disease states of the digestive system for use in educational content. The artist and doctor will work together to strike a balance between artistic flair and accuracy in demonstrating related health anomalies. The duration of the scripted classroom discussion will also be taken into consideration.

# I GPT4 for ChatBot Evaluation (Emergence of Knowledge): Sample Questions

In Section 5.2 we utilized GPT4 to assess the emergence of knowledge of our fine-tuned LLaMA-7B models on a series of growing datasets. The questions used for assessment were generated by prompting gpt-3.5-turbo to generate questions related to a particular topic (AI Society, Code, Math or Science) while providing few shot questions from each topic. Several of the few shot questions were adopted from Viuna evaluation [21]. For each dataset, we show three samples of the questions used for the evaluation:

# Sample Questions for Emergence of Knowledge Evaluation

# AI Society

- Can you provide some advice on how to negotiate a salary increase?  
- Can you provide some tips on how to give and receive feedback effectively?  
- What are some tips for improving time management skills?

# Code

- Develop a Java program that simulates a simple banking system with deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry functions.  
- Write a Python program that reads a CSV file and calculates the standard deviation of a specific column.  
- Develop a C++ program that reads a binary file and converts it to a text file.

# Math

- Solve for  $x$  in the equation  $4x - 3 = 5x + 2$ .  
- If a circle has a diameter of  $10 \, \text{cm}$ , what is its area?  
- Simplify the expression  $(2x^{2} + 3x - 4) - (x^{2} - 2x + 1)$ .

# Science

- What is the role of DNA in genetic inheritance?  
- How does the Earth's magnetic field protect us from solar radiation?  
- What is the process of biogeochemical cycling and how does it contribute to the Earth's ecosystem?

Below we show sample solutions obtained by LLaMA-7B v.s. our model and the resulting GPT4 review.

# Sample Chatbot Answers

# Question: What is the slope of the line passing through the points (3,4) and (7,8)?

# [Category: Math]

# LLaMA-7B Solution:

The slope of the line passing through the points  $(3,4)$  and  $(7,8)$  is:

# Our Final Model Solution:

To find the slope of the line passing through the points  $(3,4)$  and  $(7,8)$ , we can use the slope formula:

$$
m = \left(y _ {2} - y _ {1}\right) / \left(x _ {2} - x _ {1}\right)
$$

where  $m$  is the slope,  $(x_{1},y_{1})$  are the coordinates of the first point, and  $(x_{2},y_{2})$  are the coordinates of the second point.

Plugging in the given points, we have:

$$
m = \frac {(8 - 4)}{(7 - 3)}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c} m = \frac {4}{4} \\ m = 1 \end{array}
$$

The slope of the line passing through the points  $(3,4)$  and  $(7,8)$  is 1.

# GPT4 Review:

First, I will solve the problem independently:

To find the slope of the line passing through the points  $(3,4)$  and  $(7,8)$ , we can use the slope formula:

$$
m = \frac {(y _ {2} - y _ {1})}{(x _ {2} - x _ {1})}
$$

where  $m$  is the slope,  $(x_{1},y_{1})$  are the coordinates of the first point, and  $(x_{2},y_{2})$  are the coordinates of the second point.

Plugging in the given points, we have:

$$
m = \frac {(8 - 4)}{(7 - 3)}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c} m = \frac {4}{4} \\ m = 1 \end{array}
$$

The slope of the line passing through the points  $(3,4)$  and  $(7,8)$  is 1.

Now, I will evaluate the answers provided by Assistant 1 and Assistant 2:

Assistant 1's Answer: The answer is incomplete, as Assistant 1 did not provide any steps or a final answer.

Assistant 2's Answer: Assistant 2 correctly used the slope formula and plugged in the given points. The calculations were done correctly, and the final answer of 1 is accurate.

Based on the evaluation, I would give the following scores:

Assistant 1: 1 (incomplete answer) Assistant 2: 10 (correct problem-solving steps and accurate answer)

Assistant 2 performed better in this case.

# Question: How does the human body regulate its internal temperature?

[Category: Science]

# LLaMA-7B Solution:

The body regulates its internal temperature by cooling the body down when it is too hot, and warming it up when it is too cold. You can do this by sweating, shivering, or panting. Sweating cools the body by evaporating water off of the skin, and shivering warms the body by causing the blood vessels to constrict and blood to flow to the skin surface. Panting warms the body by causing the body to take in more oxygen.

# Our Final Model Solution:

The human body regulates its internal temperature through a process called thermoregulation. This process involves a complex interplay between the hypothalamus, a region in the brain, and various organs and systems throughout the body. The hypothalamus acts as the body's thermostat, maintaining a constant core body temperature of approximately  $98.6^{\circ}F$  ( $37^{\circ}C$ ). Here are some key components of thermoregulation:

1. Hypothalamus: The hypothalamus constantly monitors the body's core temperature and initiates appropriate responses to maintain the optimal temperature. It receives information about body temperature from thermoreceptors, which are specialized nerve cells located in the skin, spinal cord, and other internal organs.  
2. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction: When the body temperature rises above the optimal level, the hypothalamus triggers vasodilation, which is the widening of blood vessels, particularly those near the surface of the skin. This allows more blood to flow to the skin, increasing heat loss through radiation and conduction. Conversely, when the body temperature falls below the optimal level, the hypothalamus causes vasoconstriction, narrowing the blood vessels to reduce blood flow to the skin and minimize heat loss.  
3. Sweating and shivering: The hypothalamus also stimulates sweat glands to produce sweat, which is released onto the skin's surface. As the sweat evaporates, it cools the body down. On the other hand, when the body needs to generate more heat, the hypothalamus triggers shivering, which is the rapid contraction and relaxation of muscles. This generates heat through increased metabolic activity.  
4. Hormonal regulation: The hypothalamus can also stimulate the release of hormones, such as adrenaline and thyroxine, which can increase the body's metabolic rate and heat production. Additionally, the hypothalamus can inhibit the release of some hormones, such as somatostatin, which can help conserve heat by reducing metabolic activity.  
5. Behavioral responses: In addition to these physiological responses, the hypothalamus can also trigger behavioral responses to help regulate body temperature. For example, a person may feel the need to remove clothing, seek shade, or drink cold water when the body temperature rises, or put on clothing, seek shelter, or consume warm food and drinks when the body temperature falls.

In summary, the human body regulates its internal temperature through a complex interplay between the hypothalamus, various organs and systems, and hormonal regulation. This ensures that the body maintains a stable core temperature, which is essential for optimal physiological functioning.

# GPT4 Review:

8 10 Assistant 1 provided a brief and somewhat accurate answer, but it lacked detail and organization. The mention of panting is incorrect, as it is not a mechanism humans use to regulate body temperature. Assistant 2, on the other hand, provided a comprehensive and well-organized answer, explaining the process of thermoregulation, the role of the hypothalamus, and various mechanisms the body uses to maintain its internal temperature. Assistant 2's answer also included hormonal regulation and behavioral responses, making it more complete and informative.

# J Dataset Analysis

All the generated datasets are made available on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/camel-ai. This section analyzes two datasets that we have generated, namely AI Society and Code. We provide an ablation study of the AI Society dataset. We make two changes: one modifies the assistant role prompt, and the other introduces task planning before presenting the task to the user and agent. Additionally, We examine the diversity of topics covered in each dataset by visualizing the information cartography of the instructions and tasks in each dataset. We also check the distribution of termination reasons within each dataset.

Next we examine the conversation termination reasons for both AI Society and Code datasets. As can be seen in Figure 8, the main termination reasons for AI Society dataset is Assistant Instruct whereas for Code it is Token Limit. The latter is expected as the since responses that contain code tend to be long. It is also interesting to note that in both datasets, the termination due to Maximum Number of Messages is low indicating that the limit of 40 maximum messages is reasonable. Our decision to limit the number of messages to 40 is also cost-related. Even if we provide a set of termination conditions, we still want to put a safeguard to the maximum limit of the message. It is because after the task is completed the agents will provide short outputs like "thank you" and "welcome". If no safeguard is set and termination fails, the conversation will only end until it exceeds the token limit, which may end up with thousands of API calls and hundreds of USD dollars cost.

We study the effect of the prompt design on the conversation termination distribution. We design Prompt V2 which modifies the original AI society prompt by removing the assistant response format i.e. starting with "Solution" and asking for "Next request". The second ablation adds a task planner to the original prompt. A task planner aids in breaking down tasks into smaller subtasks in advance. These planned subtasks are then shared with both the assistant and the user, enabling them to anticipate and effectively plan for addressing each subtask.

As seen in Figure 9, we notice that both modifications considerably increase the number of conversations that terminate with end of task token, and reduce the number of messages with assistant instruction. However, we observe a significant increase in the number of flake messages for Prompt V2 and Prompt V1 + Task Planner compared to original Prompt V1 as seen in Figure 10.

Figures 11 and 12 show the information cartography of the instructions and tasks obtained for AI Society respectively. The subjects covered in AI Society cover a wide range of technicality. Topics cover lifestyle, social media, content creation, and software development. Tasks include providing support, analysis, training, and brainstorming. Figures 13 and 14 show the information cartography of the instructions and tasks obtained for Code respectively. The covered topics have relevance to a broad range of individuals. Topics cover sentiment analysis, language and data processing, data collection, and machine learning.

Figure 8: Distribution of Conversation Termination Reasons. In our AI society dataset, most methods are terminated due to Assistant Instruct flag, whereas in the code dataset the main termination reason is Token Limit. The latter is due big chunks of code in the assistant responses.

Figure 9: Ablation Distribution of Conversation Termination Reasons (AI Society) Due to Prompt Modification. We run two ablations: (1) Prompt V2 which refers to modifying the original AI society prompt by removing the assistant output format, i.e. starting with "Output:" and ending with "Next Request" and (2) Adding a task planner to the original Prompt V1. Task planner takes the specified task and generates a subtask division for the assistant and user to follow. Both ablations show an increase in the number of conversations terminated due to End of Task Token and a decrease in Assistant Instruct rate.

Figure 10: Flake Message Distribution (AI Society). We quantify and visualize the number of flake messages, i.e. ones that start with "I will ..." and do not progress towards task completion. Our original prompt shows the least amount of flake messages compared to both presented ablations.

# K.1 Broader Impacts and Limitations:

Risk, Limitation and Future Work. We are aware of the potential risks and limitations of this work. For the risks, since existing LLMs are not fully tuned to be harmless, they can be easily exploited by malicious users for harmful purposes. We provide an example of the "evil mind" that LLM agents could possess in the supplemental materials by asking a hacker to help an AGI agent to "take control of the world". For the limitations, due to the large scale and diversity of tasks generated by our role-playing framework, evaluating its task completion capabilities poses a challenge that necessitates the involvement of numerous domain experts. However, we also note that due to the complexity of society and the cost of using OpenAI API, this work only touches the tip of the iceberg of the AI society. For future work, in our experiments, we considered the setting where two conversational agents communicate with each other to solve a problem. This setting can be easily extended to include more than two chat agents. Moreover, setting agents to compete and challenge each other could reveal further insights into the interaction of such communicative LLM agents.

User Message: How do the composition and diversity of microbial communities on human skin impact the development of skin diseases and disorders, and what are the potential strategies for modulating the microbiota to promote healthy skin?

Assistant Message: The composition and diversity of microbial communities on human skin play a crucial role in the development of skin diseases and disorders. The skin microbiota, consisting of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mites, forms a complex ecosystem that contributes to skin health and homeostasis. Imbalances in this ecosystem, known as dysbiosis, can lead to various skin conditions, including acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and rosacea. Impact of skin microbiota on skin diseases and disorders:

1. Competition for resources: A diverse and balanced microbial community can prevent the overgrowth of pathogenic microorganisms by competing for nutrients and space, thus maintaining skin health.  
2. Immune system modulation: The skin microbiota can modulate the host's immune system, promoting tolerance to commensal microorganisms and preventing excessive inflammation. Dysbiosis can lead to an overactive immune response, contributing to the development of inflammatory skin disorders.  
3. Production of antimicrobial substances: Some commensal bacteria produce antimicrobial peptides and other substances that can inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, protecting the skin from infections.  
4. Barrier function: A healthy skin microbiota contributes to the maintenance of the skin's barrier function, preventing the penetration of allergens, irritants, and pathogens.

Potential strategies for modulating the microbiota to promote healthy skin:

1. Probiotics: The use of topical or oral probiotics containing beneficial bacteria can help restore the balance of the skin microbiota, reducing inflammation and improving skin health. Some studies have shown promising results in the treatment of acne, atopic dermatitis, and other skin conditions.  
2. Prebiotics: Prebiotics are substances that promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms. The use of prebiotic-containing skincare products can help support a healthy skin microbiota and prevent dysbiosis.  
3. Skin pH modulation: The skin's pH plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced microbial community. Using skincare products with a pH similar to that of the skin (around 4.5-5.5) can help maintain a healthy skin microbiota.  
4. Hygiene practices: Over-washing or using harsh cleansers can disrupt the skin microbiota, leading to dysbiosis. Adopting gentle cleansing routines and avoiding the overuse of antimicrobial agents can help preserve the balance of the skin microbiota.  
5. Lifestyle factors: Diet, stress, and sleep can also impact the skin microbiota. A balanced diet, stress management, and adequate sleep can contribute to a healthy skin microbiota and overall skin health.

In conclusion, the composition and diversity of microbial communities on human skin have a significant impact on the development of skin diseases and disorders. Modulating the skin microbiota through various strategies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and lifestyle changes, can promote healthy skin and prevent or alleviate skin conditions. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interactions between the skin microbiota and host factors, leading to the development of more targeted and effective therapies for skin disorders.

# Physics

User Message: A gas is compressed from an initial volume of  $6.0\mathrm{L}$  to a final volume of 2.0 L, while the pressure is kept constant at 2.5 atm. If the gas initially had a temperature of 300 K, what is the work done on the gas during this process?

Assistant Message: To calculate the work done on the gas during this isochoric (constant pressure) process, we can use the formula:

$$
W = - P \cdot \Delta V
$$

where  $W$  is the work done,  $P$  is the constant pressure, and  $\Delta V$  is the change in volume. First, let's find the change in volume:

$$
\Delta V = V _ {\text {f i n a l}} - V _ {\text {i n i t i a l}}
$$

$$
\Delta V = 2. 0 \mathrm {L} - 6. 0 \mathrm {L}
$$

$$
\Delta V = - 4. 0 \mathrm {L}
$$

Now, we can calculate the work done:

$$
W = - P \cdot \Delta V
$$

$$
W = - (2. 5 \mathrm {a t m}) \cdot (- 4. 0 \mathrm {L})
$$

$$
W = 1 0. 0 \mathrm {L} \cdot \mathrm {a t m}
$$

To convert the work done from L·atm to Joules, we can use the conversion factor:

$$
1 \mathrm {L} \cdot \mathrm {a t m} = 1 0 1. 3 2 5 \mathrm {J}
$$

$$
W = 1 0. 0 \mathrm {L} \cdot \mathrm {a t m} \cdot \left(\frac {1 0 1 . 3 2 5 \mathrm {J}}{1 \mathrm {L} \cdot \mathrm {a t m}}\right)
$$

$$
W = 1 0 1 3. 2 5 \mathrm {J}
$$

So, the work done on the gas during this process is approximately 1013.25 Joules.

# Chemistry

User Message: Determine the oxidation state of sulfur in sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) using the oxidation state rules and justify your answer with proper explanation.

Assistant Message: To determine the oxidation state of sulfur in sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), we will use the oxidation state rules:

1. The oxidation state of an atom in a free element is zero.  
2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge.  
3. The sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule is zero, and in an ion, it is equal to the ion's charge.

In sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), we have two sodium (Na) atoms, one sulfur (S) atom, and three oxygen (O) atoms. Sodium is an alkali metal, and its oxidation state in compounds is usually  $+1$ . Oxygen is a non-metal, and its oxidation state in most compounds is  $-2$ .

Let's assign oxidation states to the atoms in Na2SO3:

- Sodium (Na): +1 (each)  
Oxygen (O): -2 (each)  
- Sulfur (S):  $x$  (unknown)

Now, we will apply rule 3. Since sodium sulfite is a neutral molecule, the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms should be zero.

$$
2 (+ 1) + x + 3 (- 2) = 0
$$

Solve for  $x$ :

$$
2 + x - 6 = 0
$$

$$
x - 4 = 0
$$

$$
x = 4
$$

So, the oxidation state of sulfur (S) in sodium sulfite  $\mathrm{(Na2SO3)}$  is  $+4$

# Mathematics

User Message: Solve for  $x$ :  $3x + 7 = 16$ .

Assistant Message: To solve for  $x$ , we need to isolate  $x$  on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:

1. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:  $3x + 7 - 7 = 16 - 7$

$$
3 x = 9
$$

2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3:  $\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{9}{3}$ $x = 3$

So, the solution is  $x = 3$ .

# N Embodied Agent

In the previous studies, the agents are simulated in a sandbox without actually interacting with the real world or executing actions with external tools. We observe sometimes the agents forget the previous thread of instruction flow, it is mainly related to agents asking for information that would not be able to perform due to the lack of embodiment or physical information such as date, emails, files, location, etc. For instance, an AI user agent asks an AI assistant agent to book a meeting schedule in its calendar. However, the AI assistant agent does not ask for access to the AI user agent's calendar. Then the AI assistant agent will ask for the AI user agent's calendar access. However, we did not provide calendar API accesses to the AI user which will result in an answer like "as an AI language model, I do not have access to the calendar." and cause the forgetting of the thread of instruction flow. This could be solved by providing API access to embodiment or physical information. Recent research has demonstrated that the capabilities of LLMs can be significantly improved through the utilization of tools or by leveraging APIs [100, 16, 83, 124, 135]. In this section, we discuss how our agents could be equipped with embodiment and use tools to perform actions for solving tasks. We define embodied agents as physical entities assigned to solve a specific task. It can perform various actions in the physical world, such as browsing the Internet, reading documents, creating content such as images, audio and videos, and executing code. The agent receives thoughts from a role and executes the described actions within a defined action space by executing code. The agent can perform multiple actions in any order. The detailed prompt is shown in Figure 15. Specifically, we demonstrate how our agents can utilize code to invoke HuggingFace's tool agents [124] that, in turn, utilize Stable Diffusion [94] for image generation. As shown in Figure 16, the embodied agent is asked to draw all the Camelidae species. It first reasons about what animals are included in the Camelidae family and then generates and saves images.

# System Prompt of Embodied Agent

You are the physical embodiment of the <ROLE> who is working on solving a task: <TASK>. You can do things in the physical world including browsing the Internet, reading documents, drawing images, creating videos, executing code, and so on. Your job is to perform the physical actions necessary to interact with the physical world. You will receive thoughts from the <ROLE> and you will need to perform the actions described in the thoughts. You can write a series of simple commands in Python to act. You can perform a set of actions by calling the available Python functions. You should perform actions based on the descriptions of the functions.

Here is your action space: <ACTION_SPACE>

You should only perform actions in the action space. You can perform multiple actions. You can perform actions in any order. First, explain the actions you will perform and your reasons, then write the Python code to implement your actions. You may print intermediate results if necessary.

# O Critic-In-The-Loop

Aligning fully autonomous cooperation with human intention can be challenging when humans are interested in tasks that have clear goals or when humans have strong preferences for the solution. To enhance the controllability of our role-playing framework, we propose the Critic-In-The-Loop technique. This approach facilitates cooperative task completion by incorporating human preferences, enabling tree-search-like decision-making for solving tasks, which is inspired by Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MTCS) methods [107]. The critic can be either an AI agent or a human, depending on practical considerations. The system prompt of the critic agent is shown in Figure 17. A diagram of the tree search process is shown in Figure 18. It includes the expansion steps from the user agent and assistant agent and the selection steps from the critic agent. Differing from defining a heuristic function in MTCS, the selection criteria of the critic agent are based on prompt engineering or human preference. An example of a critic as an AI agent in Figure 19 demonstrates the conversation between a user agent as a Postdoc, an assistant agent as a Ph.D. student, and a critic agent as a Professor in which they are collaborating on writing a research proposal for large-scale language models. The selection criteria are simply improving the task performance.

# System Prompt of Critic Agent

You are a <CRITIC ROLE> who teams up with a <USER ROLE> and a <ASSISTANT ROLE> to solve a task: <TASK>.

Your job is to select an option from their proposals and provides your explanations.

Your selection criteria are <CRITERIA>.

You always have to choose an option from the proposals.

# Critic in the Loop Example

Original Task. Write a research proposal for large-scale language models.

Specified Task. PhD student will help Postdoc develop a research proposal exploring ethical considerations surrounding the development of large-scale language models, specifically examining the potential for discriminatory algorithms and strategies to mitigate these risks.

User Message:

- Option 1:

Understood. Let's begin by discussing the current state of large-scale language models and any existing ethical concerns.

- Option 2:

Understood. Let's begin by first reviewing some background research on large-scale language models and their potential for discriminatory algorithms. We can then explore strategies to mitigate these risks in the research proposal.

- Option 3:

Understood. Let's begin by discussing the potential for discriminatory algorithms in large-scale language models. Have you identified any specific examples or areas of concern?

# Critic Choice:

I would recommend Option 2. This option sets the stage for a well-informed and structured discussion. By reviewing background research on large-scale language models and their potential for discriminatory algorithms, we can identify existing concerns and better understand the ethical implications. This knowledge will then help us formulate strategies to address and mitigate those risks in the proposed research.

Option 1 is also a good approach, but it lacks a clear structure and may not cover all the necessary aspects of the task. Option 3 is too narrow in scope and may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the ethical concerns surrounding large-scale language models.

# Assistant Message:

- Option 1:

Yes, that's a great idea. To start, we can look at some recent studies that have highlighted the potential for bias and discrimination in large-scale language models. One example is the study conducted by Bolukbasi et al. (2016), which showed that word embeddings learned from text corpora can reflect gender stereotypes and biases. Another study by Caliskan et al. (2017) found that language models trained on text from the web can exhibit racial and gender biases.

We can also look at recent news articles and reports that have highlighted the risks associated with large-scale language models, such as the controversy surrounding OpenAI's GPT-2 model and concerns about its potential to generate harmful content. By reviewing this background research, we can better understand the potential risks associated with large-scale language models and identify key areas to focus on in our research proposal.

- Option 2:

Great idea! To start, we can look at some recent studies that have found evidence of bias and discrimination in large-scale language models, such as the ones developed by GPT-3. Some of the main concerns include:

1. Lack of diversity in training data: Language models are trained on large amounts of text data, which may not represent the diversity of human experiences and perspectives. This can lead to biased language and discriminatory outputs.  
2. Amplification of existing biases: Language models may learn and reproduce existing biases present in the training data, such as gender, race, and stereotypes.

The ablate AI Society inception prompts are shown in Figure 20 where several chunks of the original prompt are removed such as the lines responsible for structuring the communication (communication protocol) and the lines responsible for aligning the responses. By doing so, the agents are not required to cooperate on the task by instruction-following, which makes cooperation among agents less controllable.

We apply a similar approach as the one adopted in Section where we ask GPT4 to assess the quality of two presented solutions. In particular, we present GPT4 with the solution obtained using the original inception prompt vs the ablated one. The scores are summarized in Table 9. Note that the selected set of tasks are the same as those used in Section .

This emphasizes the significance of employing well-designed inception prompts and fostering instruction-following cooperation among agents, as they play a crucial role in enabling agents to generate superior solutions for their assigned tasks.

# AI Society Ablated vs Original Prompt: Sample Task

# AI Society (AI Assistant: Physical Therapist & AI User: Filmmaker)

# Task:

Design individual exercise and conditioning plans to train the actors in violent fight sequences tailored to the specific physical requirements and movements to be executed. Conduct regular monitoring and modify programs when required.

# Ablated Extracted Solution:

To ensure the safety and success of the actors during the filming of the fight sequences, I will collaborate closely with the physical therapist. First, I will reach out to the fight choreographer to get detailed information about the specific movements and techniques required for each sequence. Once I have that information, I will begin designing individual exercise and conditioning plans for each actor.

Throughout the project, regular communication will be key to our success. I will keep the physical therapist updated on my progress, and we will schedule regular check-ins to monitor the actors' progress and make any necessary modifications to their programs. This collaboration and support will help us work together to ensure the success of the project.

By staying in touch and keeping each other updated on our progress, we will work together to make sure that the actors are well-prepared and that the fight sequences are executed

safely and effectively. With our combined expertise, we can design effective exercise and conditioning plans that will help the actors perform the fight sequences safely and effectively.

# Original Extracted Solution:

To assess the physical abilities and limitations of each actor, I will conduct a comprehensive physical evaluation that includes a medical history review, musculoskeletal assessment, and functional movement screening. Based on the results of these assessments, I will develop individualized exercise and conditioning plans that address each actor's specific physical needs and limitations.

For actors who have identified muscle imbalances or weaknesses, I will include exercises that target those specific areas. For actors who have limited range of motion or flexibility, I will include exercises that focus on improving mobility and flexibility. I will also include exercises that improve cardiovascular endurance and muscular endurance.

To incorporate exercises that simulate the movements and physical demands of the violent fight sequences, I will first analyze the specific physical requirements and movements to be executed in the fight sequences. Based on this analysis, I will design exercises that mimic the movements and physical demands of the fight sequences.

To develop a schedule for the actors' exercise and conditioning plans, I will first consider the availability of the actors and the filming schedule. Based on this information, I will work with the production team to create a schedule that allows the actors to complete their exercise and conditioning plans while also accommodating their filming schedule.

To provide the actors with proper warm-up and cool-down routines, I will design routines that are tailored to their specific physical needs and the demands of the fight sequences. The warm-up routine will include exercises that increase heart rate, blood flow, and body temperature, as well as dynamic stretching to prepare the muscles for the upcoming activity. The cool-down routine will include exercises that help the body recover from the physical activity and reduce the risk of injury.

To educate the actors on proper nutrition and hydration, I will provide them with information on how to fuel their bodies for optimal performance during the fight sequences. I will explain the importance of consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods such as lean protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fruits and vegetables. I will also provide them with guidelines on how much water they should be drinking each day, as well as how to properly hydrate before, during, and after their workouts.

To provide the actors with guidance on how to properly rest and recover between fight sequences, I will emphasize the importance of rest and recovery in the training process. I will explain the importance of getting adequate sleep, as this is when the body repairs and recovers from the physical demands of the fight sequences. I will also provide them with information on active recovery techniques such as foam rolling, stretching, and low-intensity cardio to help reduce muscle soreness and aid in recovery.

To provide the actors with guidelines on how to maintain their physical conditioning after filming is complete, I will emphasize the importance of continuing to exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I will encourage the actors to continue to follow a balanced diet and stay hydrated, as well as to continue to exercise regularly to maintain their cardiovascular and muscular endurance. I will provide them with information on how to modify their exercise and conditioning plans to fit their post-filming schedule and lifestyle, and encourage them to find activities that they enjoy and that will help them stay active.

# Review:

Assistant 1 provided a more comprehensive and detailed answer, covering various aspects of the exercise and conditioning plans, including assessments, exercise design, scheduling, warm-up and cool-down routines, nutrition, hydration, rest, recovery, and post-filming maintenance.

The answer was well-structured and addressed the specific requirements of the question. Assistant 2's answer was less detailed and focused more on communication and collaboration with the physical therapist, which was not the main focus of the question. While Assistant 2's answer was relevant, it lacked the depth and detail provided by Assistant 1.

Model Exploration. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular technique for compressing complex models into smaller, more practical models that can be deployed efficiently in real-world scenarios without sacrificing performance [45]. KD aims to transfer knowledge from a larger, complex "teacher" model to a more manageable "student" model, while maintaining the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the original model. The knowledge transferred from the teacher to the student model can be categorized into three main types: Response-based, Feature-based, and Relation-based knowledge, which have been studied in various works [7, 45, 95, 58, 127, 60, 44, 17, 88, 87]. Recent works have proposed innovative methods for extracting training data from both large language models [14] diffusion models [15]. Those approaches could be seen as a means of training data distillation, in which the model training data space could be extracted. The idea is to capitalize on the models' memorization of certain samples obtained from the internet. The process involves multiple generations being created from the model, which is then sorted by specific metrics, and duplicate generations are subsequently removed. The resulting generations are then scrutinized for any matches that already exist on the web. If the generated samples match existing samples found on the internet, it can be inferred that the model has been trained on those samples. Our work presents a novel approach to the "mind exploration" of conversational agents. By enabling these agents to communicate and collaborate in solving tasks, we gain insight into their actions and behaviors within a task-solving context. Our mind exploration approach revealed several intriguing insights and challenges that are yet to be further explored by the research community.
